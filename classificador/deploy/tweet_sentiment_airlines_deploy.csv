@AmericanAir u Cancelled Flightled my flight for tomorrow and tell me to call reservations but then refuse to take my call!!!  #not cool #hateful
"@USAirways that link leads to a website that won't open on a cell phone.  Good job, shocking that your airline is folding."
@USAirways been on hold for 2 hours for something which I could have done in less than 1 minute if it was available.Your site UX is awe full
@SouthwestAir are passengers automatically rebooked on other flights if original is Cancelled Flighted for weather etc?
@AmericanAir thank you for the robotic and non helpful assistance.
"@AmericanAir @USAirways cost me a day of vacation ($350 hotel stay), day of dog boarding, and a day of airport parking."

@JetBlue when will you release flights for February 2016?
"@SouthwestAir unveils 4 new #flights, including 2 from #Ohio http://t.co/grkBj7bxlk"

"@AmericanAir @marxsterbcow How is this a real life response to a customer service issue? Seriously. Keep trying to call us. Eh, might work."
@HillAConlin @SouthwestAir hi! get a solar charger from Amazon! Game changer to plug usb into charge. :)
@JetBlue you wanna help out? How about you reimburse the money you cause my band to lose.
@united ...she said she would need to get a supervisor. While waiting for the supervisor she hung up on me.
@AmericanAir @cnnbrk she tried they are not doing anything said they would talk to stewardess about serving drunks drinks how does that help
"@united I did already rebook, and now I will miss my first appointments in London tomorrow morning. Thanks for ruining my trip - AGAIN!"
"I'd like the 11c I originally tried for @AmericanAir - again, happy to pay the difference"
@USAirways Yes thank you. Appreciate u checking...

"@united I know. I‚Äôm sure you hear it all the time ‚Äî don‚Äôt like the new seats. I‚Äôm a small guy, 5‚Äô 6‚Äù and I feel the new planes are tight"

"@JetBlue if u want to be helpful save me the trip from Westchester Cty to JFK, plus parking - my info is in the photo http://t.co/JI7xkS2jkk"
@united I should be fine. They automatically changed my connecting flight for me so I wouldn't miss it. A+ work.
"@SouthwestAir  Tried to leave Monday, all other planes left but mine. Now this one keeps getting delayed. Missed work. Have to pay for a cab"
@United terrible illogical re-route after Cancelled Flightled connection. Then made me pay to check bag. Then lost bag. #ual
@united UA7985 is a coshared flight w/ ANA. Unable to check in 24 hrs prior.

@AmericanAir good care of their customers if anything happen to then take you @Delta  for getting me back to NYC !! Screw you @AmericanAir
@united how can your app show arriving aircraft is early but departing flight is delayed due to Late Flight arriving aircraft? @unfriendly
@SouthwestAir looking forward to the beats music available on my flight today. That's pretty cool.
@AmericanAir What happens when you combine Top Chef &amp; the beauty of San Miguel de Allende. My Late Flightst food blog.  http://t.co/7t1rDRCRe6
@JetBlue The chairs could use some TLC. And more power outlets in the area would be a bonus. Headed to @UniversalORL !
@AmericanAir there are no more flights via united when I arrive to DFW and my car is parked at IAH üòÅ
"@united yes #LHRT2 lounge is fantastic, if only the US ones could be remotely similar!"
@united 30 hours Late Flightr still no answers stuck in Houston. Keep getting put on phantom flights that never apeared. #BadCustomerService

"@united #1007 Houston-Bogota with an engine problem, mechanics trying to ""fix"" the problem, safety first, better to change the plane"
@USAirways The fact we did not get notified hindered our ability to look for alternate flights before they were snapped up.
@JetBlue - why does my TSA-pre work with every airline BUT you? I pay good money for that. Spent 30 mins on phone to fix to zero success.
@USAirways stranding a student trying to get to Birmingham in CLT overnight w/o any help.  You can do better than that.  @av_duffy
"@USAirways This is garbage, been trying to book a reward flight and then it got Cancelled Flighted and still can't get anyone on phone. Unacceptable"
@JetBlue I flew on a flight about 3 months ago. Me and my girlfriend got away with having sex in a restroom. Is it allowed now?
@united My flying United is over...sorry. The Captain still had 20 minutes of pre-flight preparations to make while we sat with no air!
@JetBlue saved the day:) @Expedia lost a costumer #jetblue #makingthingseasy #feelbetter
@USAirways And cherry on top-flight 880 was on runway after we landed ON TIME for 45 mins. Still didn't get half the luggage.
@virginamerica Looks like a broken link for your assets https://t.co/OArDjjGrrD
@united an efficient layout at kiosks/bag drop lines would help as there is no definition to space. Additional friendly and helpful staff
@AmericanAir Flight 35. I'm on my way.
@USAirways can they change to correct last name? Did via reservations already but said can't change ticket name..
"@AmericanAir yea no worries. I'm just going home to Denver. Not your fault, weather sucks bad."
@SouthwestAir Luvin me some flights today!! Don't change!!  And please add Paypal as payment option!!!
@AmericanAir Can't get thru by phone to use a credit that's about to expire! #frustrated #aa.com
@united this happens all the time.  United pilots are always in the exit row.  America treats there customers better than their employees.
"@AmericanAir even when I did get through, no one knew anything about my bag. This is ridiculous, I still don't have my bag from Saturday."
@united when a 2 hour flight turns into a 3:30 ordeal...sigh
@united rep wouldn't rebook. This is such a waste of time and poor communication
@USAirways @AmericanAir  best u could do-I might get my refund within 2 billing cycles. Months of u guys asking for another chance. I'm done
@SouthwestAir rules.
@JetBlue I do follow you!
@JetBlue id appreciate that. Would also you mind contacting the pilot of my flight and request that I be allowed to announce over intercom?
@SouthwestAir's CEO Kelly draws record crowd to @BWI_Airport Business Partnership breakfast http://t.co/hrvuKtpvn1 http://t.co/MY3dnVBZAZ

@AmericanAir what are the odds my bag was picked up by someone not me while in another country? Because it says it hasn't been located yet.

@USAirways First class no snack basket was catered so drinks only No preflight drink or coathanging 1st drink service 50 min after take off
@United is the worst major US airline.  More proof: they're boarding the plane with the outside galley door open in 0 degree weather.  Wtf?
"@USAirways even if I was the single most unreasonable human being on planet earth, there is no excuse for his treatment of me."
"@VirginAmerica I paid the premium to fly you across the country, you Cancelled Flight my flight and offer no check fee or upgrade love? Sad face :("
"@united no, didn't notice I was 38A until start of boarding. Assumed I was 8E. By time boarding started, GAs had cleared standbys, full flt"
@JetBlue Are there issues with the mobile boarding passes? My app keeps crashing when I try accessing. Thanks!
@JetBlue didn't work. Fly-fi plus couldn't access ABC app. So I spent $19 and still missed Oscars. #disappointed
@SouthwestAir Yes I can. But you guys should get your act together.
@VirginAmerica YES FYI  MY BFF
@united online inchecking able in the Netherlands (ams)?
@united why couldn't you have changed the tire of my delayed UA1127 flight when it arrived instead of waiting until boarding?
‚Äú@JetBlue: @maatkare67 We hope you're still our bae! @TatianaKing @thewayoftheid‚Äùhaa man

@USAirways yet again your staff in Philadelphia  failed to send my luggage home with me. #alwayshappensthere #angrytraveler
@USAirways of course weather was a joke 43 beats 5 degrees in PHL! ‚õÑÔ∏è‚òÄÔ∏è
@united has me stranded in Texas and then hangs up on me when I'm trying to figure out how to get home. Cool.
@JetBlue do you have direct flights to and from Bos to St Lucia or Antigua?
@USAirways why load us on the flight if the captain was over the hours he could fly in one consecutive period? Unacceptable.
@AmericanAir please can you tell me why DFW has a weather advisory and RDU does not? the entire state of NC has shut down from ice &amp; snow!
@united just kidding with you I'll send you my stuff now. Thanks
@united I have been given a connection with 2 overnight layovers. No vouchers. Last connection not even confirmed.

"@USAirways your service at PHL is abysmal. An hour on the runway waiting for a gate, no information anywhere, missed my connection abysmal!"

@AmericanAir this delayed bag was for my friend Lisa Pafe. She got her bag after 3 days in Costa Rica. Issue no updates on your system.
@AmericanAir the reservation system won't even let us leave our phone #. I have no way to fix that you rebooked me on wrong day!
@USAirways on hold now over 2 hrs on one phone hung on 5 x on another? How do you reach a person? No weather condition makes this excusable!
Spend 1 HOUR on hold with @USAirways .
@VirginAmerica How do I reschedule my Cancelled Flightled flights online? The change button is greyed out!
"‚Äú@AmericanAir: @TilleyMonsta George, that doesn't look good. Please follow this link to start the refund process: http://t.co/4gr39s91Dl‚ÄùüòÇ"
@USAirways thanks is there a beareavement discount anymore or not should I just book online
@united is my favorite airline.
@SouthwestAir I also find it ridiculous that I've been tweeting to you since 3:50 AM EST and have still received no response. 9 hours?
@SouthwestAir I'm going to need you to answer your phones. Being on hold for an hour isn't okay.
@united 3 hour 45 min delay so far..... Would love to round to 4 hours to just go to bed!
@USAirways Need to talk to a person about my bag. Waiting on hold for two hours. Bag s!b delivered last night. Online says not found.

@JetBlue Re: Flight 8088 SXM&gt;JFK what time does bus leave hotel on Feb 22?  Mass confusion here.
@AmericanAir nah u boofin u dont talk like any humans i know. Respond like u actually have a brain. And again i dont want customer relations
@jetblue are going to let Fl382 into a gate in BOS any time soon? We're just sittin' here on the tarmac  waiting.
"@USAirways I sympathize re:weather issues, but when times get tough, call in more folks. Over two hours on hold for 4-minute fix. #FAIL"
"@USAirways Literally all that says is ""Case open""  What good is that to me?"
@USAirways flight from Bhm delayed 5hrs! Connect flgt left us in clt at a motel
@united No. The entire problem here is that I was never sent anything via email and only given a Flight Booking Problems number over the phone.
Not your fault @JetBlue Social Media Awesome People. I know everyone is working hard to get us in our way.
@AmericanAir it's not about the weather. It's about the fact that I can't get ahold of anyone to help. BUT you can tweet me back.
@JetBlue you #fail. Snow coming to DC area. Tried to get on earlier flight. You refused. Now flight 6.5 hours delayed. Greedy and foolish.
@USAirways help im falling out of one of your planes
@USAirways customer service fail... Todays experience will ensure I do my best NEVER to utilize you again...
@southwestair has posted flight schedule covering the date range of @_defcon_ 23

@AmericanAir have been in call cue for 11 hours. No call yet. Wife in cue for 9 hours.  Got a call but was hung up on.
@SouthwestAir I've been on hold for 2 hours!  When will you answer??
@united sent a DM just now. Thanks I am incredibly happy the fast response I got via Twitter than via customer care. Thank you
@USAirways waiting for you to figure it out. This is unacceptable.
@USAirways what do I push to rebook with that 800 number
"@JetBlue friendly, engaging, personable, handled clarifying questions about baggage fees well, and took an interest in what I was doing."
"@VirginAmerica beats expectations, shares take off - Santa Cruz Sentinel http://t.co/qm9dQbai6G"

@united: No friendly skies from you today. 5hr+ weather delay in SFO followed by 1hr+ mechanical delay while sitting on plane. #NoFun
"@united they're not, actually. gate agent was so rude. now standing in a line waiting for reFlight Booking Problems. missed the only flight to STI. awful."
@united this is besides the fact that one week ago you delayed me by 18 hours. i am not impressed at all.
@USAirways thanks for the seat that doesn't recline. I'm shocked I'm not being asked to serve everyone drinks on the plane.  #DoBetter
@USAirways Used 2 get emails 1) pre-purchase a snack and 2) when time to check in. Got neither 4 tomorrow's trip. Do they not get sent now?
"@USAirways Best part was hearing the attendant give a voucher to person next to me for hotel at BGR. Then my guy saying ""we don't do that"""
@SouthwestAir once or twice a year. Hard to get vacation time from work sometimes. But love flying with you guys!
@SouthwestAir now I don't get the common courtesy of my phone call answered. Either policy is bad or people should be fired. #dissaponted
@USAirways -- I've been on hold 40 mins to Cancelled Flight my reservation for this afternoon. Is there another way? Web tells me to call.
"@USAirways any updates on Flt 1848, here at the gate and they have no expected time of departure"
@SouthwestAir we're doing our best; sitting at a gate waiting (while not being given information why we're delayed) isn't making this easy
@United rescheduled my return flight from #Japan?  Uh why?  Trying to call #UnitedAirlines #customerservice - 45 min wait.  #fun
@SouthwestAir I'm in line at the airport right now. Will you cover hotel fair or am I to sleep in the airport?
@united how about after 2.5 hrs at ORD another .5 on the tarmac + refuse to move me to an earlier flight you make it up to me? #iflyalot #bs
@united Why do I pay more for Coach Plus to be told preboarding that all overhead bins will be full for me

"@USAirways We did. @AmericanAir said to open one with you, too."
@USAirways ok...i know doors close ~10 minutes before takeoff. stop telling me my flight will leave in 20 minutes when we haven't boarded.
@SouthwestAir you need to get your act together. You new this morning at 830 our plane was malfunctioning. Yet I've been delayed 3 times ..

@USAirways @TheHaileyTate Another blatant lie from @USAirways
@AmericanAir we have posted your response on facebook for everyone to see people are appalled by your lack of concern
@United how do you lose a gate checked bag DEN to ORD? Direct flight. Ugh.
@AmericanAir could you check if there is SVU space on AA199 MXP-JFK Feb 28th? Thanks
@AmericanAir I am honestly in shock how this process and service compares to my other airline experiences. Not really sure what to say...
@SouthwestAir breaking my heart at BWI 9 hrs @business
@JetBlue the pilot just stated that after 22 years of flying he has never experienced anything like this. #gettingoffplane
"@SouthwestAir @fox8news Serious potential for a wanna get away commercial out of this debacle.  But for real, you should fire @Kristi_Capel"
@JetBlue Noooo!! Why is our previously direct flight from FLL&gt;SFO diverted to LAS? Now arriving almost 2 hrs Late Flightr. üëé
@united Not sure what you are talking about. She is going on nonstop flights. SNA to SFO and then SFO to EWR.
@USAirways 45 minutes on hold no help
"@SouthwestAir you call this customer service?? Sitting in the tarmack for 1hr, lost bag, and you give me a $100. voucher???"
"@USAirways ""Owen F"" at DCA Gate 42: #rude."
@united love being told you would issue a refund when you couldn't get us out of the way of a hurricane to have it denied
"@AmericanAir You've misunderstood. @USAirways WOULD NOT do a same day flight change for me. The gate agent said, ""NO."""
@JetBlue I'd go to Australia to enjoy the land down under! Always been on my bucket list! #FlyingItForward

@united yes I've boarded this way many times &amp; have never had to show my pass on the Tarmac multiple times. Path was railed off. Only 1 way
@JetBlue thank you will do!! You guy are awesome!
@USAirways I NEED TO *SPEAK* TO SOMEBODY ABOUT A RESERVATION. As in talk to a human being. Yet your computer system puts the phone down on

@AmericanAir I paid seat upgrade b4 the severe weather.  Got booked on another flight but did not get upgrade. Was calling to inquire. HELP!
@united That's not the issue. The fact that no one even called (despite promises) to confirm the bag's location is.

@USAirways I totally understand the weather. Just frustrated. Thanks!
@AmericanAir I saw it finally come through on the mobile app. However it's for tomorrow and I have meetings tonight that I'm trying to make.
"@SouthwestAir, I've been on hold for 3 hrs. now, waiting to talk to someone with a pulse to get my Cancelled Flighted flight rescheduled. Is this SOP?"

"@JetBlue I tried! Had me running from curb-side to self-check &amp; wasting even more time. Ended up Flight Booking Problems United for $$$, am so upset"
@AmericanAir The issue is the lack of consideration of an announcement made so Late Flight when the gate agent had been there for over an hour.
"@JetBlue I flew to San Francisco from Fort Lauderdale with you last year, had a fantastic time so would like to go back !"
@AmericanAir These are some awesome photos. Thanks for sharing! üòÅ

@JetBlue what happens when I have a confirmed flight but no seat available during online checkin except for Even More Space upgrades?
@JetBlue yup 33036 feet. But no selfie.
@SouthwestAir how do get priority seating after you already paid for the flight
"@united I'm saying I made the flight but with poor/non-communication, unaccounted for lost time &amp; lots of frustrated flyers standing around"
@JetBlue you reimbursed everyone on the flight a portion of their ticket. I still love JetBlue! Best American airline!
"@united worst airline in the world-8 delays, gate agent loses her mind over 1.5 lbs and charges me $100 on top of the $25 I already paid!!"
@SouthwestAir loses baggage a day ago and still has no idea or interest in finding it? ALL items for new job in that bag! Unacceptable.
"@united so going forward, I shouldn't be Flight Booking Problems Star Alliance flights through the United App?"
@JetBlue Let's just say #IDontWannaLiveWithoutYourLove https://t.co/i9KCgaxxFa #ItWasMintToBe #BestInClassSocial #ThankYou #Travel #Business
@SouthwestAir sitting in Newark because flight 4179 was Cancelled Flightled for no apparent reason.  All I was told was sorry after 2.5 hrs waiting
@united arrived in YYZ to take our flight to Taiwan. Reservation missing our ticket numbers. Slow agent Sukhdeep caused us to miss our flt.
@USAirways Unfortunately I doubt that the consistently subpar service will improve with the @AmericanAir merger. #USAirways
@SouthwestAir What's up with the wait times on your customer service line? Tried 2X on Fri. and now I've been on for over 15 min.
"@united Very good flight, thank you!"
@VirginAmerica no A's channel this year?
@SouthwestAir #flight #Cancelled Flightled...tried to get refund but on hold. Can I get it after my flight would have departed?
@USAirways oh the irony. A dog who will not spot barking in waiting area is now right in front of me! Please send me a cocktail coupon stat
"@USAirways quick, let's board a plane so that we can sit on runway for 2 hours #clockwork #scareways #neverfails @AUmilo1"
"@AmericanAir I didn't want to Cancelled Flight, I wanted to take someone off and keep my price. Held at 402, at 10am today 440, now 530"
@USAirways so you're going to make me wait that long on the phone line when you can help me? # that's part of the problem
@JetBlue why is flight 1106 delayed out to NY? Same problem?
@USAirways I got an email asking me to checkin TMRW for a flight I meant to book for 3/19 - can someone please help! @WallStSlumLord @PKG49
"@VirginAmerica it's really aggressive to blast obnoxious ""entertainment"" in your guests' faces &amp; they have little recourse"
No they didn't -.- ‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/58B7swRpmq‚Äù
"@united I'm not sure how you can help. Your flight experience is terrible, planes are dirty and staff is rude. Start over perhaps?"
@AmericanAir gotta be worse than @delta w/ on time departures.  I rushed back to terminal C for 8:25 flight but they haven't strtd boarding.
@United DO NOT FLY UNITED WITH CHECKED BAGGAGE! It will never find you!
"@JetBlue flight from JFK-SFO was pure awesomeness. Mint Class and Tim our attendant was the best! Other airlines, take notes!"
@USAirways Our flight was Cancelled Flightled &amp; chaos abounds. I am in good humour. Please give me free everything to appease me.
@SouthwestAir wow! Some things are better forgotten!
@SouthwestAir is this a joke? My return flight is delayed too! 3 in a row! New record from you guys üíîüò™
@SouthwestAir great day in the air. http://t.co/YNc2ZUt4zz
@VirginAmerica already contacted Central Baggage &amp; sent DM. @RenttheRunway is charging me for the dress that was in the lost suitcase #help
@united A change fee of $200. Same exact flight from ATL-HOU is $165. Why a charge of $574? The math doesn't add up.
@USAirways see you on board tomorrow
@united I sent a message. It's very irresponsible that my suitcase cannot be found. This is truly worst service ever... #fedup #disastrous
"@AmericanAir @maryella_green just received it, actually. Thank you!!!!!!!!!"
"@united @czamkoff It's all about profit, and they don't really give a damn about paying customers!!!! #greed"
@united No customer service rep could confirm where my bag was &amp; each gave me different info. Ruined 2 events I had today. #disappointed
"@AmericanAir FYI twice now I've tried the ""we'll call you when someone is free"" thing. Both times it called, I picked up, then it hung up."
@united we were not given the option of using our United TravelBank in a recent Flight Booking Problems! Any help in using or recouping these funds? Thanks!
"@united I have a flight from omaha to chicago (en route to NYC) and they are seating me and my partner separate, please fix this res# ILC0HP"
"@AmericanAir @GolfWithWoody Don't buy it, Woody. They're making it MUCH worse with understaffing, rudeness, and pre-rookie mistakes"
@VirginAmerica you guys messed up my seating.. I reserved seating with my friends and you guys gave my seat away ... üò° I want free internet
"@USAirways Your ""moveup"" policy really sucks. United has a 24 hour policy for this with status. I was wanting to move up from 5am to 7am..."
"@united that's what you have said for years, you are losing customers!!!!!!"
@USAirways thanks :)
@AmericanAir  A true #AmericanView ...The National Mall http://t.co/N7ExdbcRHg
@AmericanAir weather is unavoidable. Understaffing is controllable

"@SouthwestAir is really stepping up their ""service""üê© http://t.co/VQTyza6Mzu"
@USAirways thx for delayed checkin on noon flt to mia then forcing me to take Late Flightr flts which were delayed. Cincy to Miami in 13 hrs! #fast
@SouthwestAir sat on a plane for 2+ hrs on 2/15! Then we finally took off.. :(
@AmericanAir hey I got a call saying our flight was rescheduled but I can't get through to anyone to see if you're providing a hotel for the
@USAirways   No one picks up the phone all day/  no opportunity to leave a voicemail
"@AmericanAir #AmericanAirlines 1 1/2 hr wait for bags. If this is the a taste of the worlds largest airline, heaven help aviation"
@united Maybe be hiring your own ground staff at LAX when multiple gate agents tell you your baggage is loaded you expect it to be. HOPELESS
"@united that would help! or how about integrate it into the App so I can just ""activate"" it and surf..."
@JetBlue I applied for a job at PDW where could I go for follow up. I'd really love the job #ilovejetblue
@USAirways Thanks!
@AmericanAir THANK YOU FOR ALL THE HELP!  :P You guys are the best.  #americanairlines #americanair
@SouthwestAir may want to direct that to the people at @FurryFiesta tok
@USAirways I packed a carry on for a reason. Thanks for making me check it. I hoped for better customer service in CLE also. #nothappy
@SouthwestAir i have asked Lindsey to call me instead of DM like a schoolgirl but so far no call   Getting tired of typing little notes
@united worst service ever üòà
"@united See? We were told repeatedly that the pilot was Late Flight and kept getting Late Flightr.  After we boarded, there was a defibrillator issue."
"@JetBlue where is the ""award winning service""?"
@SouthwestAir has the best customer service!
@AmericanAir I'm booked for Tuesday night. 60 degrees in Alabama right now. I'm good. Stay warm and safe.
@AmericanAir Can you respond to my DM?
@united the os isn't controlled by me but rather @VerizonWireless .  App is new.
"@united so our flight into ORD was delayed because of Air Force One, but the last flight to SBN is at 8:20, 5 mins from now we just landed."
@USAirways I left something on a recent flight today. Who do I contact to retrieve it please? Thanks!
@southwestair SWEET!!! Glad to hear it. I'll keep you guys in mind next time!
"@AmericanAir..still here. feet are freezing b/c doors have been open. Flt time was 8:30.  We have fuel but now waiting for ""rampers"" #AA4285"

@SouthwestAir what about for us that cant get to the states they are playing for the hunt? Any DestinationDragons tickets left?Even just one
@AmericanAir Connection is US2065
@united Can you tell me Jet Airways award availability?
"@United of urgency, but this is ridiculous. Your ceo claims to be customer focused, yet when delays happen, planes sit and customers are"
@SouthwestAir Unable to check in my flight. It says my itinerary is ineligible for checkin online. Go to counter. Very inconvenient!!!
@JetBlue thanks so much!

‚Äú@united: @Darquenloveli We regret to hear this. Please let us know if you need assistance. ^KN‚Äù I was finally able to secure my seat. Thx
"@JetBlue yes, please get me the seats we paid for."
@SouthwestAir thank you for the confirmation. Maybe people on my flight have directional dislexia.
@USAirways great but that still does not help me..
"@SouthwestAir if you're going to charge for wifi, do us all a solid and make sure it doesn't take the length of the flight to open a page"
@united cleaning a regional jet takes an hour?
@VirginAmerica why is flight 345 redirected?
@AmericanAir leave our luggage in the baggage claim without any previous information! That's not the deal!! http://t.co/oTTy5rYMzD
@SouthwestAir I agree! RT @9NEWS: One airline is the fly-away favorite at DIA  #9NEWSBusiness http://t.co/o3WlaInImY
@SouthwestAir 25 year customer but I am 6 3 and those lost 2 or 3 inches really hurt  every time the person in front shifts he raps my knees
"@united I'm not this person, but I've been sitting in Denver for three hours and all I want to do is get on a plane. Please let me go home."
@JetBlue thanks...
"@SouthwestAir bumped me to preboard on both flights (because I'm fat?) Whatever the reason, thanks!"
".@united just curious why you'd board a flight without a pilot. Seems crucial to the flight process, no?"
@united where is my flight voucher?
"@USAirways I've been on hold for 35 mins to sort out my reservation out of sync message when trying to check in, what's wrong?!?"
@united better just keep connection from ORD To FWA that boards in ten minutes open until I get off the plane that just landed an hour Late Flight
"@USAirways figure it out, have had 2 Cancelled Flightled flights in the past week. Now coming home 2 hour delay, and cart that pulls plane just broke"
@AmericanAir its not weather thats why i said the other people received hotel rooms while the people at the end of the line did not get them
"@united never fails, flying FC order ravioli get chicken. Tell the FA she says you should of told me, other people wanted chicken..idiot."
@SouthwestAir - any update on flights in to BNA today?
@united flight...gotta make this connector
@united worst flying experience ever and they tried to blame it on ATC?! I watched them load bags for 30min after boarding 45min Late Flight
@USAirways Still irritated that our well planned and booked return was messed with &amp; with no warning.
"@united if you're going to Cancelled Flight flights today, do everyone a favor and get on it now. Don't stall the inevitable."
@usairways - It's all automated and no one cares to understand the problem I'm having
"@USAirways No. Just felt that you could do better in making the emails feel a little less of ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt care. We‚Äôre automated."""
@united FAIL You Cancelled Flightled our flight frm GJT and then used our reserv home to IAH (from SEA) for reFlight Booking Problems w/out OUR PERMISSION!! #PH6RPS
@united thanks for all the help! Totally appreciate it and you made it super easy too
@AmericanAir Lost black wallet at #DallasAirport.I was on flight 2208 to CLE.Would appreciate ur help. Last I used it at @Starbucks on A20.
@jetblue fly 2301 delayed do to ice at JFK ... Can I switch to a Late Flightr flight for free
@SouthwestAir sadly didn't get much help ... As a travel agent this is so disappointing to me.

‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/vw2v8GVnGq‚Äù üòêüòë
@USAirways I'm sure you don't but question still remains why we only found out at 8.20 that crew won't come before 9.50 for 8.10 flt. Tks.
"@JetBlue yes, but it hurt my feelings to walk by MINT. A fella can dream. #happy4them"
@SouthwestAir why doesn't your terminal B in LGA have pre-check? Makes me want to never fly your airline
"@united so you told me to go, knowing what the issue was, only for me to go there and find out that you won‚Äôt fix it?"
@SouthwestAir how many left?! I'm 15 min wway
@united correct?  What's correct?  Sorry I'm lost
@united for a fee...
@AmericanAir I just checked the app and it said my flight had been moved back a day? No explanations why. No answer on the 800 number.
@AmericanAir makes some small improvements and retains their program they win all. They keep the crappy food and change advantage they lose
@AmericanAir I put a call back in at 1AM and still nothing at 8AM. You think you might get back to me?
@AmericanAir many trips coming up!  I will see you soon üòÉ
@AmericanAir  I have still not talked to anyone. You guys should be prepared for these situations. How is this good service? I am so mad!!!
@USAirways What a mess caused by the computer systems. Flight 719 in 3 hours Late Flight and now no gate for us. Est 26 min wait.
@united I want my bags. There is vital equipment in there. You are royally screwing me. I'm cranky and want an update.
@SouthwestAir unfortunately I don't even have that. My phone died before o had a chance to grab it. It was from OMA to SAN from 3/27-4/2
@JetBlue @EllaHenderson omg!  Wish I had a flight today!  Haha there's always next time!  Have fun at #LFT5
@USAirways it's not often that an airline is so easy to work with. I needed to change my flight time and the attendants at MKE made my day!
@USAirways how long are you going make us sit in this plane while they repair it? Could I at least get a beer???
@SouthwestAir : thanks.are flights operating now or Cancelled Flightled?
@VirginAmerica Thanks!
"@SouthwestAir can tweet through the weekend/ bad weather, but closes down customer relations center to process refunds for Cancelled Flighted flights."
@JetBlue Aw okay thanks
@united @perfectomobile You really shouldn't use the word 'crashing.' Just sayin'.

@SouthwestAir still on the ground &gt;30mins after planned departure. And this is California. No weather here. Originally told 10 min delay.
@AmericanAir I tried that. They won't book us with another airline. I wish I had flown with you! We are now stuck in FL til Weds.

@united you are terrible.
@AmericanAir how does one book a ticket online and put it on hold?  Does that require that I pay for the ticket?
@SouthwestAir Your onboard wifi is so bad it's taking me 20 minutes to send this tweet.  Working is off the table. #disappointed
@SouthwestAir no her lunch was over by the time she got her call answered

@USAirways No I missed the funeral so I had to take a train back to Newark

@USAirways if I cant get through to reservations how can they take a look? 2+ hour hold times are not reasonable in any industry!
@AmericanAir . Death of a dear friend has me heart broken but #AmericanAirlines has me heated!
@SouthwestAir had to Cancelled Flight my flight because my Cavalli calves was interfering with the onboard equipment.
"@united My wife has been on the phone several times for past 3 days, with no result."
@USAirways flight #3900 fro ORF to PHL.
@AmericanAir thanks for following up- it finally worked!! Fingers crossed the new flight works.
@AmericanAir help http://t.co/hYrAo7A4Uu
@JetBlue When I checked yesterday it looked like it did. Did something change?
@united Why isn't the flight status updated to delayed UA1532 no board
"@united ""We like hearing from you."" So why haven't you replied to my tweet and/or email yet? https://t.co/caf2cx3gfi"
"@JetBlue and of course that was supposed to say Logan, not login"
"@JetBlue I now learned that customer service at SXM works for the airport, not JetBlue. They need a supervisor to do anything."
@AmericanAir ...have you seen Blue? Go look it up :)
"@USAirways i have never been treated so poorly by an airline in my life, as a military family we do alot of flying.."
@united keep me updated. Let me know that the bags make the flight to j-burg
"@AmericanAir no hold times, just disconnections.   There is no excuse for that"
@SouthwestAir it says I can't because my flight is in progress.
@united I will be patient as your agent explains how you have me booked on a new flight for 6:18 when that plane doesn't arrive until 6:07
@united so unhelpful... http://t.co/vBfIeo2qJC
@JetBlue Counting on your flight 989 to get to DC!
@AmericanAir Flight attendant #YeseniaHernandez provided excellent service among peculiar conditions throughout the day ‚úà :-)
@SouthwestAir Engadget Theverge Wired reddit
@VirginAmerica wish I can afford to fly with you next Friday  going back home.. love everything  about your airline
@AmericanAir You didn't respond to my DM. You tweeted the same canned tweet you're telling everyone else.
@USAirways has the most ass backwards process for using credits on flights. even trying to get a hold of customer relations is impossible
@JetBlue rocking the Tim McGraw hold music
@USAirways why now just announce delay of 4478 from PVD when you knew captain was already on delayed flight coming in? Frustrating
@united Thank you.
"@USAirways @AmericanAir ""ma'am the doors close 10 mins prior to departure"" ""but I was here 20 mins before?!?"" laughter from the 2 agents"
@JetBlue whatever your lil #mint heart desires! http://t.co/WmX12F33ZC
@SouthwestAir Flight 2646.  Four hours in the plane on the ground at BWI.
"@AmericanAir For the love of all that is holy, if your automated phone system is going to give like 8 options, give numerical shortcuts"
"@SouthwestAir Thanks 4 the great service, staff, letting me change my flight 5 times for free! PVD to the skies for me always on SWA!"
@JetBlue BOS. Everything current now. Thanks for the follow up
@USAirways Excited that I'll be flying from Syracuse to interview in Dallas on Friday for the FA position- this is a goal &amp; dream of mine!
"@AmericanAir on plane for JFK-&gt;SFO, been sitting here for 1.5 hours waiting for push crew, how is this acceptable?"
@VirginAmerica and it's a really big bad thing about it
@USAirways i've been on hold since 11:30pm  need to reschedule my Cancelled Flightled flight for a morning departure tomorrow.  please help!!!!!!
@SouthwestAir luggage delivery between 1-4am? Really? After I was told by midnight multiple times? Why lie? Crazy and bad business.
"@USAirways, I know you're dealing with the weather, but @PHLAirport is a hot mess. Pls send reinforcements"
@USAirways Seat 8D on Flight 545 last night is the worst seat I've ever been in.  No leg room! #dividendsmember http://t.co/NUhpLNXRIq
"@southwestair Hi, how do I add a flight to my account? Just created it"
@VirginAmerica Grouping Virgin in with the others now. BOS weather has exposed their actual Cus Serv model. Never Flight Booking Problems with Virgin again!
@USAirways I have a voucher from a past trip that was delayed. I thought I had to talk to someone on the phone to use it. Is that not true?
@United gate announcement states delay due to maintenance yet app says Late Flight arriving aircraft  tell the truth! @unfriendly
@USAirways me too. Me too.
@united you might be the only airline not offering waivers...keep up the good fight
"@AmericanAir thanks, me too"
@SouthwestAir frustrating indeed especially when no one knows what the issue is....
@united how is it tripitPro has accurate delayed dept. times and 2hours Late Flightr I hear the same from you? Just curious
@united I did. The AC went on for about 20 minutes before returning to the Mojave Desert. #PressureCooker #HeatTrap
@JetBlue something they're not telling us (2)
@united why are your agents working so slowly to rebook people who are on #UA1481. We have all wasted an entire day at STT.
@JetBlue note the time this was taken (now at 906 am) and flight still listed as on time for 910 when I'm not onboard http://t.co/zvfmxnuELJ
@VirginAmerica are you ready!? Let's say it together.. 'Noooo turbulence today!' üòò
"@AmericanAir I paid extra $ for my seat &amp; the monitor didn't work from on AA111. How about a refund on the seat? Conf #: MDBEEI, McMullen"
@AmericanAir don't worry you won't steal my money again
@united thank you for listening to my compliant and doing the right thing. I appreciate you working with me
@SouthwestAir got it squared away. Thank you. I had a man on the inside help me out!
@USAirways 2 hours on hold. Still no answer. Horrible.
@united Kurt and the crew on UA1745 were amazing today. They made my son's birthday with their kindness. Hope to fly with them again soon!
"@AmericanAir so if your genuine, give me your opinion  on what occurred last night 445 fly  from phl, to mia. No assistance at airport"
@AmericanAir Can you provide guidance on how I should work with them to resolve the issue
@SouthwestAir Yay! And are dependents with ID (wife children) eligible to use this discount too? How do you use it over the phone/inperson?
@AmericanAir got back eventually! Was a rollercoaster. Once I got to the airport &amp; got to speak to someone things got fixed very quick.
@USAirways sure knows how to pamper customers they strand abroad. #badcustomerservice #fend4yourself #youareonyourown http://t.co/Pw1eudlcZg
@SouthwestAir Thank you for having flights going out of Nashville! You guys Rock! #DisneyPrincessHalfMarathon #girlsweekend #bffs
@USAirways I did and it's been a disaster. You had me sitting on the runway only to bring the plane back to the gate smh
@JetBlue Learning about your awesome twitter management today in my Social Media Marketing class! keep up the good work! @SXU @PhD_Mama_
@united have you inspected the picture? routine aircraft check while on his cell phone? What will the FAA &amp; NYT say ? http://t.co/bNgpli8JT6
I hate you all. RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/uTdfqF5WPA
@united officially has the most inefficient boarding procedure. There is no reason it should take 45 mins to board a plane!
@JetBlue how come you're responding to everyone else and not me #wtf
@USAirways 40 minutes in baggage claim and no sign of luggage from our flight. UsAirways- your incompetence is overwhelming
"@SouthwestAir Promotion also said two free round trip flights. Nope, had to pay $200 extra for chi to Vegas. Bait&amp;switch."
@AmericanAir I've been on hold with international award reservations for almost 2 hours. 800-433-7300 keeps calling me. what is going on?
"@SouthwestAir RT @kkwhb: Paid for early bird boarding and got B46.  I said to lady, ""well, that system is about dead."" She didn't understand"
@SouthwestAir how about some sweet promo code to help me visit my family!!!.... Please!!!... Lol
"@AmericanAir I can DM it to you, if you follow me"
@SouthwestAir Thank u Thank u Thank u for coming through for us! I sincerely didn't think it would happen. &lt;3 #SWA #THANKYOU
@JetBlue I believe that the website said I could receive credit for upcoming flights since I Cancelled Flighted my last one. Is this true?
@USAirways #Wronganswer. Talk is cheap. Customer service is the action of making things right for the customer. #fail again.
‚Äú@USAirways: @ch_mom Please reach out to our crewmember for assistance. Our apologies for the long wait.‚Äù #generic
@united my baggage is in shannon now so never mind u can work on giving me some $$$ back now

"@AmericanAir still no reply to my email sent on 11th February. Even sent an email asking for acknowledgment that's it been recieved, nothing"
@VirginAmerica Flying LAX to SFO and after looking at the awesome movie lineup I actually wish I was on a long haul.
@united despite my bag not making it to Newark good informative email tracking updates help!
@united I wrote to you but got nothing.and I am out of US .It is very simple thing.Will ypu provide compensation for your delay?
@united the drunk guy you threw out of flight UA936 4hrs ago is better off than the rest of us held up for 5hrs in the plane without food.
@virginamerica why don't any of the pairings include red wine?! Only white is offered :( #redwineisbetter
@SouthwestAir 2 hrs to put a tag on my bag sayin it should go to greenville instead of Raleigh?! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!
@SouthwestAir what's yall corporate number bc yall are not trying to accommodate me at all!!!
@united I just booked a flight for (2). When I view my reservation it has MI connected to First name. Is this a problem? can it be changed?
@united a report was filed with the airport police on 11th and 12th February-I have the police case number if required
@SouthwestAir Conf #8Q6MFD Finally got through &amp; told the flight was completely booked.  That would have been better info than advise 2 call
@united Thank you! Off to LA to do something very special.
@united thanks.  Not tonight it would seem. http://t.co/WNdcEO5QlK
@JetBlue ANYWHERE!! http://t.co/FeFHPmFPlE
@AmericanAir the group of minor children were broken up into groups. Some still in Miami. Delta has much better customer service!
@AmericanAir absolute terrible service to schedule a 40 minute layover and then not let someone on the plane with the door not closed.
@SouthwestAir  got my bags 35 hours Late Flightr and an offer of $50 to go pick them up. Taxi costs $65 one way. Spent $200 for the inconvenience.
@JetBlue I tried a burger which was good but expensive! Were lead to believe that food in the USA is cheap butnot here!
@USAirways thank you

@USAirways it is an extreme inconvenience to make ppl check bags when there's a lot of overhead space left. You lie so you're not at fault
"@AmericanAir Hi, did the discount award policy for credit card holders change? No longer seeing the chart of specials on the site. Thanks!"

@JetBlue oh. And thank you for responding
"@AmericanAir Telling frustrated customers ""we are super busy, please call back Late Flightr kthxbai"" and then hanging up is not the best practice."

"@VirginAmerica I just did, how can I DM? Do u have to also add me?"

"@united What happened this afternoon? Huge amt of incoming planes to SFO delayed over 1-2 hours.
Frustrating!"
@SouthwestAir yes please.my son lives in NJ.
@JetBlue not an issue but I think training &amp; information would help. Great ppl but service needs to switch from individual to group better
@united I can't even look at you right now. I'll call you when I'm not so mad.
@USAirways once again your company actualy put people in weird situations.Your hostel voucher was fake.Snow is ok but no lies please
"@AmericanAir Great, thanks. Followed."

"@usairways you made us miss our flight, first class now I can't even enter the admirals club.  Not happy  dm me to fix this."
@JetBlue how about free wifi on flt 1254 out of PBI to make up for 2.5 hr delay? Treat us right.

@AmericanAir thanks for the generic computer generated response. How about you accommodate your travelers instead of just saying sorry
@USAirways just hung up on me again.  Another waste of an hour of my time.  How am I supposed to book a one way award flight?  #badwebsite

"@JetBlue I understand delays.  We are all looking at a tv monitor at ur gate and it says current conditions are snow, hence delay."

@VirginAmerica has flight number 276 from SFO to Cabo San Lucas arrived yet?
@AmericanAir I can't keep dialing you guys all day. Can I get into the callback queue?
@USAirways Call volumes are high so the best answer is to hang up on me?
"@USAirways Handled on the phone. Unfortunately it wiped out an entire trip, which is why I'm so displeased."
@SouthwestAir answered. My options are a refund or a resched for Monday (I'd miss work). So I'm paying hundreds for a @USAirways flight tmw.
@AmericanAir It is now going to be reported to the police due to the sexual assult sad that you didn't care
@USAirways would be more pleased if you reassess your business practices.  Goal should be to have passengers on plane as little as possible

@AmericanAir Trying to rebook a flight with you because of Cancelled Flightlation is a nightmare.  I was hung up on once. Can you help me rebook?
@AmericanAir will do on another airline that's more accommodating of its customers. Unable to simply change passengers with notice is simply
@united 3359 which you finally Cancelled Flightled.
"@united fair enough, but it stinks to be the passenger on the plane that leaves the gate then sits on the tarmac for an hour before takeoff"
@united But thanks for asking
@SouthwestAir thanks! Very excited to see it :D
@USAirways thanks for a subpar travel experience and it's not even over yet #stepitup
@united thank you. Literally called for preboarding as I ran up.
@SouthwestAir how do I find travel funds I have available to use f/ past changed flights? don't see an option in my account.
"Bruh...real tweet from @JetBlue ""Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/dqny4aKTg9"""

@united Cancelled Flighting. bought a ticket for a friend but cant get the credit under my name
@jetblue Vegas desk said JFK connect would b held 4 us and 26 others on our plane now staff at JFK says weather was problem. #epicfail
@USAirways then drop your fee! $150 ($300RT!!!!) makes no sense; most EU airlines charge $0. @AirCanada charges a reasonable $50.
"@united do you think there Will problems at Newark, NJ on Saturday due to expected snow?"
@USAirways technical issues = inefficient computer triage system. Personality/ compassion of operators = not. Sad example of sad company.
@AmericanAir I purchased Main Cabin XT for f-1571AUS. Flight was Cancelled Flightled and I was rescheduled on 1600 with regular seats. Credit?
"@JetBlue Why not just take her info in the beginning and if cut off, call back? We do that in my medical practice. We are frequent flyers :("
"@USAirways okay, great. Thank you!"

‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/yZH4ZRQM0i‚Äù really JetBlue? #fleek?!!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ hell no... Yall petty
@AmericanAir u didn't give an answer why the flight delayed so long. and how do u compensate missing my other flights Lima to Cuzco??
@SouthwestAir you cx'ed almost the entire east coast flights All other planes are taking off any traveling fine I need to get to Nev ASAP
@SouthwestAir Yes! Just a few minutes after my tweet. She was able to reschedule her flight. Thanks!
@USAirways Nice try.  Doesn't apply to Philly.
"@SouthwestAir sucks. Passengers leaving the plane to make room luggage, checking luggage and getting back on. Delayed flights to same city."
@united load balancing system apparently down #systemwide - major impact on all #united airlines flights. Was this a #cyberattack?
@united I was protected on that flight by gate agent Kerry at LAS. She also did an excellent job getting me to my destination today. Thanks!
@united thanks for moving my dad on to my my mom's flight. You helped make his birthday start with #FriendlyFriday Awesomeness! 4 paws up!
@SouthwestAir how does your pre boarding process work? Basically anyone who doesn't want to wait their turn can get a slip?
@united Please consider letting flyers with no overhead bin items board/deplane first (after first class). Make sense?
@united Slightly better. Crew spent a long time searching for better altitude. Would have helped to let pax in on why all the sharp drops.
@USAirways well this is #nofun #nocustomerservice #onhold trying to make #reservations #nothappy http://t.co/m7MMq2f5FA
"@SouthwestAir I have a credit that expires a month before my flight, is there any possible way I can have that extended?"
@united hi I left my asus tablet on flight to Heathrow from Newark on 16th feb and wondered how long it takes for someone to check if found?
"@AmericanAir By the time the 2 hrs passed before I got a call back, the ticket was more $$. It wasn't my fault yet I had to pay extra"
"@united @baldordash Rebooked,arrived 8 hours Late Flightr.  Last year 9 hrs to San Diego and the no inflight entertainment!"
"@united Hopefully They will give me a feedback, bafore my flight..."
"@SouthwestAir really appreciate the follow up, I always fly with y'all for a reason!"
@united has an United flight ever been on time. #americanisbetter
@SouthwestAir Flight 1700. (PHX TO LAX) Wheels stop.  Glad to be home!  Thanks to the professionals both up front and in the cabin!!!
"@united I am buying 2 yo own seat on 3 legs of intl trip, car seat? Required? If not- then allowed? Can child still sit w/mom after takeoff?"
@SouthwestAir why did you book my hotel twice?!?! Ahhhhh
@united traveling with @MegZezzo who is injured. Gate agent in Chicago was awesome helping her. TY #roadwarrior
@United are you able to see if there are seats open on another flight??
@SouthwestAir SEA to DEN. South Sound Volleyball team on its way! http://t.co/tN5cXCld6M
@SouthwestAir hasn't evennotified us that theflight isdelayed via email/text/phone call.If we wererunning Late Flight I would be pissed #unreliable
@united Where are my bags!!!  They weren't in LAX like your promised.  9 out of 10 things today were a mess today because of you.
@JetBlue thank you for not even coming with a solution. Great service I might say...as a TrueBlue member I am totally dissatisfied...thanks
@united hi.I am still waiting for the refund. This is ridiculous.Or u approve my tickets or u give me a refund.Please advise wht is going on
@AmericanAir Don't require us to memorize a five-word phrase and remember it after we hear another six million options
@SouthwestAir @poisonpill76 im in same boat.. 8am flight to Jacksonville... Get me out of here!!
@JetBlue thanks!
@united I did. they told us the wrong carousel number.
@AmericanAir i will be writing a very detailed letter to you all about this experience today. I have never experienced such awful cs ever
@JetBlue we are on flight 751 and were returning to the gate can you provide any information?
@JetBlue I sure hope you guys get me to DC to speak tomorrow! &amp; @JohnNosta &amp; @United: I'm winning here with @JetBlue
"@united any way you can help me find a flight to LAS? Stuck in DIA, sat on plane 2 hrs, now been waiting an hour for an update."
@SouthwestAir any particular reason it's 20+ minutes and counting to speak to a human being?
@SouthwestAir has the absolute worst customer service when trying to reach them by phone.
@united  Otis in the baggage claim by Bay #8. not at all happy but not nearly as pissed.
@AmericanAir We've sent you more info via DM.  I truly hope you resolve this very quickly. #media #filmcrew #cnn #nbc
@USAirways i will be Cancelled Flighting my us airways credit card and choosing other airlines after my experience this week.
@AmericanAir why would I even consider continuing your point program when I received no perks or continued bad customer service? #senseless
@AmericanAir ...why would you sell seats for a 7 hour flight with half of the legroom occupied by an escape raft? http://t.co/DTHEyOFXrB
Oh yeah? RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/FTv2NWWQF1‚Äù
@SouthwestAir  Longer flights with 300 series no wifi? Will be great when you retire them.
"@americanair flight veers off icy runway at @dfwairport. Most DFW flights Cancelled Flighted Monday, Flightaware says. http://t.co/atwyiFh6Zy"
"@united  delayed about 8 hours because of missed connections due to mechanical issues on 1st flight. rebooked, but please call me 9148445695"
@AmericanAir thanks for following up. I think it's fair to refund the ticket price and the two one way rental cars I had to buy.
@united sitting in the middle for the first time .. Hope it works out well
@JetBlue - I will for sure. But my TSA-Pre works with other airlines. Why is Jetblue different?
"@AmericanAir 4 phone calls, 2 hrs of being sent back &amp; forth between two lines in the terminal and it's the skycap that finds a solution"
@virginamerica how's a direct flight FLL-&gt;SFO have unexpected layover in Vegas 4 fuel yet peeps next to me bought for Vegas flight. #sneaky
@USAirways I did &amp; was told I asked to many questions. bag might still be on flight 413. Should be easy to check when it lands in Seattle.
@united hey! DM not working. UA 307!
@JetBlue can't wait! I'll be the one who can't contain herself. üòÑ
@USAirways haha no worries you guys are the best!  +1 for spelling my name correctly
@united Extremely disappointed in #Flight6831. United left crew and pssgrs stranded in rain @ gate with no cover. Left Psngrs 2 depart plane
@SouthwestAir Thanks I get that. It looks like all BWI-SJD services stops after Aug 7. Is that the case? I cant find one date with flights.
@united 6 minutes to boarding at b12 in Ord. No sign of gate agent. A little help?
@USAirways I should also add the weather conditions are terrible. Expecting 18 inches of snow. Any advice?
"@united Thanks Yup I'm all set.  It happens.   SLC ground staff were prompt,  helpful and courteous."
"@SouthwestAir when I called I was told my bag had made it to PHL, but still has not been delivered or any call from the delivery service"
@united Good luck with the no-enertainment-on-6-hour-flights strategy. Innovation at work. Hello @jetblue http://t.co/HI76BOavXY
@united also forgot add our bag is probably going to just sit in New Jersey because of a missed connection.
@AmericanAir who do I need to talk to to get a full refund on my trip? Your call center offers no assistance.
@SouthwestAir guess where Ashley is. She's doing a great job presenting. #ragandisney http://t.co/5ZNMwxDI9U
"@AmericanAir @americanairlines #BQONPA flight #1641 delayed from POS-MIA, missed #2214 MIA- ATL need seat on last flight to ATL."
"@SouthwestAir Flt 463 San Jose, CA -&gt; Denver, CO. Delayed 2 hrs but easily best flight + touchdown in all my years flying. Keep it up!"
@JetBlue we are well aware. Insufficient info. No options.

@united Male agnt in LAS threatens Canadian cust when cust takes pic of him at gate after agents announce can't help rebook. #friendlyskies?
@AmericanAir Your agent sent our family on 3 diff planes to dfw that were as Late Flight due to delay as the Cancelled Flighted plane that started this #fail
@JetBlue Come on and provide service from Destin- Fort Walton Beach Airport
"@Usairways thanks for making miss connection, getting rebooked, missing that too, and a miserable day. Started my day @ 4:30am for nothing!"
@united But it's doubtful he'll fly United again and he will be traveling a lot as a sales manager covering all of North America
@united thanks for the info I already knew...
@USAirways Another great flight #FunFlightAttendants. Thanks for showing my dad wonderful customer service. #flt635 #LAX #PHX #SundayFunday
@AmericanAir - Please find my bag!! In Singapore for three days already without my bag. Last known destination LAX Tag: 580815 Please help.
"@AmericanAir 

Fantastic support by the Twitter team. I appreciate it. Thanks again."
@USAirways - so far so good this week. SAV to CLT boarded BEFORE the departure time (first time in 4 weeks). Perhaps an on time departure?!
@united  flight 441 on 2/4 was delayed over three hours because the pilot never showed up!
@united there is a sector whereby it says $0 in both bags...no bag allowance at all in international flight?
"@VirginAmerica why Cancelled Flight flight VX413? One sec its delayed, on my to airport, the next its Cancelled Flightled?Gonna email or call me to reschedule?"
@JetBlue any thoughts on waiver of change fees for travel out of Boston this weekend?
@USAirways International
"@united On top of this, a CSR went ahead and hung up on me after I called United to discuss this."
@united next flight? Don't think I'll be spending anymore money with you guys ever. It was that bad.
@united I'm confused. After your @Dulles_Airport agents directed us to go to your website after DELAYS nothing works! http://t.co/cypRHe5GOK
@SouthwestAir want go from New Orleans houston see my dad at md anderson can you help me out

@united mechanical issues causes delay and connecting plane at ORD only needed to wait 10 min for them. Refused and left early instead. Wtf
"@JetBlue flying out of BUF 2 BOS, missing captain... Really? Delayed til 2:00... Not happy..."
@united just informed you don't reimburse for issues due to weather. this is why your flights keep getting Cancelled Flightled--Thor hates you
@united quick (serious) question - any resources/ratings showing the quality of service is better than 8th place? http://t.co/deWIthPeW2
"@JetBlue JFK T5 north check in. 3 bag drop ladies, 1 has been checking in someone for the entire time; another doing check ins too."
"@USAirways  ""please call Late Flightr"" is not acceptable - but neither is being on hold for 5+ hrs #onholdwith"

@united I somehow think I'm going to be stuck paying for a hotel room in Denver without winter clothes on my dime.  I guess we'll see.
@USAirways 2 hours and counting. ..what kind of travel voucher do I get for this??
"@AmericanAir Yay, thanks! Appreciate the help, I know it's NUTS right now with the cold and ice!"
"@USAirways Spoke on the phone 3 or 4 times, but no resolution. I'm still waiting to get my money back but now prices are jacked up"
@AmericanAir she should not only get a refund but also an apology for the deplorable service.
@JetBlue i only take jetblue to travel and i have to go to maimi next year but you guys dont go to maimiüò≠ why dont you guys go to maimi???
@AmericanAir why can't @dfwairport have the capability to spread salt on a runway?!
@SouthwestAir it eventually arrived. just seemed really slow. :)
@VirginAmerica Just DM'd. Same issue persisting.
@JetBlue @TatianaKing @thewayoftheid I feel only a few free travel vouchers will assuage my indignation.
@VirginAmerica i would like help with some flights please.
@united what's with the layover in Canada from the UA125? Is that scheduled?
@USAirways your people are kind and hardworking the infrastructure you have given them is horrid #massivefail #failphone #fail
@JetBlue I don't think I'll be testing those waters out on my own dime again.
@SouthwestAir i sure hope you are able to get my bag to Memphis for tomorrow.would be nice to have some clean clothes for work.
Thanks. ‚Äú@USAirways: @fispahani Weather disruptions have caused some of our crew to run Late Flight. We're sorry for the delay to your flight.‚Äù

@AmericanAir - very upset with my hometown airline. Stuck in Den Flt Cancelled Flightled. Others here with me got new Flt info
@USAirways this is going to take up to an hour--not okay USAir. Not okay. This is ruining everything.
@SouthwestAir I'm going to start charging you for the consistent body pat downs. Starting to feel like a piece of meat. #punishedforflying
@AmericanAir now 2 hrs! Guess I should just hang up &amp; give up on using my award miles before prices jump? Hm thanks http://t.co/LE4H2gTzXZ
"@united Not until tomorrow night. And the hotel voucher had higher rate than travelocity Not loving cost, but hard working staff"
@united it was delivered! Thank you for making sure it arrived at my doorstep!

@SouthwestAir when you're on hold with southwest for over 2 hours and it automatically hangs up on you. #iusedtoloveu http://t.co/tEFHpuWMdJ
@united I looked on the email chain and there is not one
"@united instead of making  seats smaller/thinner so u can jam more people on a flight,u should concentrate on maint &amp; happy customers"
"@united Still do not have my bag, it's in the CLT airport. Was originally told I would have it by 2pm."
@USAirways how hard is it to unload bags in order of arrival? 45 mins and counting for flight 699
@JetBlue we want room and food allowances. Agents are refusing to give us vouchers to use at rooms we book ourselves.
@united no wifi on #ua688 #SF to #Chicago? 2015. That's all. Ps: This tech intro video is a joke. #EpicFail
@united how else would I know it was denied?
"@SouthwestAir Been on hold over 90 minutes. You can fly, but not answer the phone?"
@SouthwestAir I am genuinely surprised you all don't upgrade people when you Cancelled Flight their flights or at least put them in a comparable spot
"@AmericanAir I fly American because of family but severe weather excuse so I can't call to make change, why have a computer if u cant modify"
@AmericanAir how about some rampers at gate b40 dfw?   Waiting to be marshaled in
@USAirways Thank you.
@united pleasantly surprised with quality of service and flight.Flew LGA-CLE-DEN. Friendly crew. Love the concept of #byod #worksnicely
@united Have clients with an 11 hr layover at IAH (during the day). Will they have to claim &amp; recheck luggage. Or will it be taken care of?
"@USAirways Cancelled Flights my flight to NY 3 times, then once I make it here they decided for S&amp;Gs they'll Cancelled Flight my return flight too. Thanks."
@JetBlue they miraculously fixed the plane #kudos to shoe ever it was
"@JetBlue if there is a ""processing error"" the  why do you send out full flight tickets and confirmations? #FlySouthwest"
@JetBlue that's ok! It just sure seemed like it when JetBlue tweeted us back and asked us to send selfies of us watching.. Haha
"@AmericanAir great, thanks!"
@AmericanAir I have been waiting at this airport since 11 am and have to wait until 8:30 tomorrow and cannot get any sort of help!
@SouthwestAir Why can't I find a cheap flight from DC to St Louis? The prices went up like crazy for April weekends!
"@united yea, a refund. Your airline ruined our trip."
"@JetBlue 1472, FLL to LGA. This is getting old. 4th @JetBlue flight in 2.5 weeks, 4th significant delay."
@united  Delay DEN-CLE because they have to manually enter baggage tags? Really? Worst cust service day for this 1ker. #friendlyskies??
@AmericanAir  you have now lost my luggage for40 hours holding for4 hrs on phone #wtf is this how you treat your loyal passengers?#stranded
"@SouthwestAir ""Will my luggage be on that flight?"" ""No"" ""Y not"" ""bc ur on that flight n it won't end up where ur goin http://t.co/6Zj6L2ZTua"
@united yes still need assistance I don't have a flight home due to change in flight u made I miss all connections !
"@united Well, to the degree that he could... Just to know, after this experience I'm Cancelled Flighting my miles card. Thank god for @Delta"
@USAirways I've been waiting for desk for 45 and on hold 36min and counting...photo of desk agent on phone not flattering.
@USAirways contd.. They put her on 7 pm flite tonite. I think she's on now. Worst customer service ever! U need to fix it.
".@united It's worth saying that, if you litter in Singapore, you get caned. ""But there are rules"" says @united"
@USAirways Please hold US1765 for me. Need to get home tonight before weather. Almost there.
"@united Yeah, I tried that about 10 times for two different tickets, and it told me to ""Try again Late Flightr""."
@AmericanAir  your customer service is deplorable. I am disgusted in your company and the ignorant people on the phones for lost baggage.
@SouthwestAir do you know that your lost baggage portal http://t.co/hUcLXluV5h doesn't work on mobile? It's a 404 http://t.co/O4ZR27Qpcr
"@AmericanAir @russelneiss No, American. This is simple. How about YOU call HER back with the info for her new flight. Basic customer service"
@SouthwestAir on hold for 45 mins. Anyone hv a connection at SW or at another airline to get from CHI n Columbus to EWR in am?
"@united what do you think missing meetings is worth?  A flight voucher?  I fly all the time, so what would make it right?"
@USAirways  And now your half assed plane is falling apart. Some one tell my family I love them! #DoBetter http://t.co/UA6doUA34l
@united your Airbus a320 seats are awful. They don't recline.
@united  once again your customer service at the providence airport was horrible. Do you actually care about customers or just making money?
@united Why haven't you released a travel advisory for IAD for tomorrow????!!!!!!!!
@JetBlue continuing you record of never having a flight leave on time. Add up how much time with with my family you have cost me. #jetblue
@USAirways that seems unlikely without a crew here to board us
@united Just checking in again - what is the status of our claim.   It is going on 2 months with no attention to this?   We are very upset.
@SouthwestAir hope your flyers get a credit of some sort for all the delays and Cancelled Flightlations #shittydeal #notimpressed
@united &amp; finally he was told he couldnt use the front of plane restrm (he was row7) though myself/others in rows behind him used w/no issue
@united ANOTHER F*CKING DELAY IN THE PAST 32 HOURS!?
"@united Arriving 25 minutes early is nice, but not if equipment isn't ready. Waiting 30 minutes for luggage, so far. Time gains wiped out."
@JetBlue I knew the 3-4 hours sounded odd; missed a flight we hit JFK an hour early for and your gate  attendant told us 3-4 :(
"@JetBlue Spent most of the winter in NNY with Mom,  JetBlue will take me home to FL via BOS on Mon. Miss hubby, kitties, warm #countingdown"
"@united, American never had my bags apparently. United never switched them over. Had to go back to United Baggage Service."
@united Just submitted my response on the link you sent.

@united Thank you for the cheese platter and abundance of entertainment options. Time just flew by.
@AmericanAir I thought all those planes were retired? #MD80
"@united has been showing the same tone deaf video for all these years about how ""wifi is coming!"" Hah.Not before I leave. @VirginAmerica ftw"
"@USAirways I saw online you had fee but I was wondering if there was a way to pay for it ahead of time, instead of at the kiosk"
"@AmericanAir no no no, YOU DM me, I pay you money and you want to me to reach out to you for help? How about the other way around"
@united still sucks. I don't understand why you have two cust service agents for a long line at Houston international b gate #unitedsucks
@AmericanAir ok makes no sense tho Since you'll give me a free upgrade to first.
@USAirways I booked a flight yesterday but didnt receive an email confirmation and I my dividends number isn't registering. Please help.
@USAirways i dont need to check status of my flight because i was ON the plane and you had a door malfunction. Get it together!!
@AmericanAir thanks. Delivery status??
@united Read my bio. See who I work with. I have NEVER encountered this with your airline before. Disappointed is an understatement.
@JetBlue Why are you making it so freaking hard for me to say good things about you??  #jetbluefail http://t.co/v8SB0RBICx
@SouthwestAir please let those with nothing in overhead bins to exit first. Fly a lot and only bring purse. Tired of running for connection
"@united screwed up our reservation- they assigned a new # to just one of us &amp; when they changed our flight, only changed the original #."
@AmericanAir thanks... I finally got through this afternoon.  :)
"@united - thanks for your help...got me what I need, but its an issue with @_austrian . I guess I sit awhile longer."
@united thank you
@united ours in July. You have ZERO excuses for this. You have an out-of-date system that causes problems like this.
@AmericanAir you really need some customer service training for your unhappy EEs in the morning in Chicago. Gate K20 at 430 chking her schd
@united https://t.co/jpd7NsGRT7. Fyi your staff are telling customers to try other carriers
@united Will have to try standby in Denver tonight or will have to Cancelled Flight father son trip till next year. Thx for trying.
@AmericanAir how can I when system always hangs up on me?
@USAirways pilot says that we are going to take off in 10 minutes. So maybe the systems came back online?
"@VirginAmerica thank goodness!! Also, see you friday, nwk&gt;sf.. BOOM!"
@VirginAmerica How can I watch the #Oscars2015 on my JFK-&gt;SFO flight?

@united  @DENAirport United 787 in snowy Denver. http://t.co/w1AaKJumXA
@SouthwestAir I think I'm shot. Can't find a flight that arrives before business (SAN) on thu. Really want to go too.
@AmericanAir the issue wasn't a long wait. It was an infinite do loop. Your system didn't let me (or any customer) wait or leave a message.
"@united 3pm and my bags still not here. not even a courtesy toiletries kit. not the flight experience I was expecting, very disappointed."
@AmericanAir hahahaha! This is crazy! Well here's to another night at the airport!!
"@AmericanAir I love travel with yours planes, all people is very nice, it's amazing! Can you please follow me back? üòãI love the company!"
@united you board a 630a flight and then Cancelled Flight it because it doesn't have a pilot?  Now I miss my meeting Atlanta because someone slept in?
"@united Nope, no more chances. Your airline messed up both ways of our trip."
@united my son is a passenger on flight 3710 from Chicago to Toronto. The plane came within feet of colliding  another plane and is stopped.
"@JetBlue No, the flight wasn't until 9:51pm, but it's already been delayed."
@AmericanAir Any reason why my 1463 flight to Chicago is boarding and I still don't have a seat assignment? Seriously?
@united yes lots. You have terrible customer service at Newark and despite raising a complaint there we were ignored hence the tweet
@AmericanAir Additional fare cost $19.. Tix change price 195 UK Pounds ($304). $19 not the issue the 195 UK Pounds IS ! #badcustomerservice
"@AmericanAir Also, I have to wait more than 2 hours before I can speak to someone on the phone?  I can't wait 2 hours.  :("
@JetBlue don't know if u define that as a #ControllableIrregularity
"@USAirways after 5 flight Cancelled Flightlations we finally get a flight, get to the gate on time &amp; you've given our seats away? Seriously??"
@AmericanAir Gabriela in Miami is a very rude employee.Working the MIA-LGA check In. She made experience unpleasant.  #customerexperience
@AmericanAir delayed flight six hours. Missed international connection= extra night in a hotel and still have to pay for a 15lb surfboardbag

@USAirways so upset with customer service. I have a simple question and the phone system has disconnected me all day today and yesterday.
@USAirways the flight that I did not connect to was 1857.

@SouthwestAir Incredibly frustrating. I emailed but still haven't received a response.
@united - SERIOUSLY it's 2015?!?!  NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589.  You're the ONLY airline without WiFi...
@JetBlue dropped 3x in past hour
@JetBlue Any option for luggage assistance on the ground at HPN? Flight 2168 delayed 2+ hours &amp; we will have 2 sleeping kids when we land

"@united sorry for the delayed response. It was UA #381 Chicago to San Fran. Held up for almost an hour on the Tarmac. Also, lost my bags"

"@united Awesome flight crew on UA1589, re the plane,  the  Jurassic period called and they want their dinosaur/plane back!"
"@AmericanAir for tomorrow some sites show flight 1642 from ewr Cancelled Flightled, is it?"
"@SouthwestAir the woman working the counter in philly at 630 this am needs to be fired. Due to bad weather, I along with other passengers"

@USAirways who's in charge of your company? My wife missed her connection to CA you sent her luggage on another flight
@JetBlue didn't find them unfortunately :( but he was very helpful and took down my info incase they do get found
@JetBlue I'm a trying ! But I'm tired and getting grumpy !
@SouthwestAir this is ridiculous. It's been 2 hours on hold to rebook Cancelled Flightled flight.
@JetBlue Flight 136 departs 2:14 AM  Finally!!!  Arrived JFK with no psgrs at 5:39 PM.  That's a long flight. AKA BUS http://t.co/KfKjF1ZtGi
@united @getmeontop 7 WEEKS Late FlightR AND I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY MILES FROM THE MileagePlus Gift Card $150 STARBUCKS CARD I HANDED OVER!!!
"@united @airlines. Agents arguing about check bag announcement. Looked for room until seat 20, gave up and walked back to seat 7.Unnecessary"
"@united once again you guys didn't let me down, a four hour delay to Honolulu from Houston, thanks for the train wreck of issues now coming"
@AmericanAir awesome. Thanks!
@USAirways. R U aware your wait time to talk to a sales agent is always 30-60 minutes? Unacceptable. At least employ a call back feature!
@JetBlue Yup. MCO. 82¬∞!!
@USAirways was rebooked but sucked big time. Crappy layover. Customer service very sub-par.
@united I have never been more frustrated than my conversations with United who can't speak Spanish to the courier company that has my bag!
"@SouthwestAir 14 hours????  Sorry don't get it. Oh well. Screw the weekend in Az right?  Eat the hotel, no problem."
@united have you read your own same day travel change policy?
@USAirways reservations had me on hold for 2 hours only to hang up...smh üòï
@USAirways ~45 minutes means no public transit home and an expensive cab. Promises doesn't make up for it
@united our flight attendant @superben was super helpful in finding a bag we left on a flight today. Excellent customer service. Name fits.
@AmericanAir 1) I was on 1610 today to YYZ. I had a bit of a bag issue that was cleared up beautifully. Thank you to all of the check in
@JetBlue would a storage container like this green one be acceptable to check in with luggage? 18Gal totes http://t.co/mJtK2SFuhG
@USAirways still waiting #brokenpromises #notnice #neveragain #tellyourstory
"@united its been five days, I'm just asking you to clarify your policy on car seats. I don't want to have to take this higher up."
@USAirways My bags were supposed to be delivered to NYC last night (missing since Thurs) but are not here. Can someone call me?
@USAirways a big thanks to the gate agent flt5127..keeping us informed of the delay#greatcustomerservice

@united I'll be calling soon but going tomorrow like it shows on the app is not a good option
"@united hi JP, with the help of an awesome TSA representative, I was able to get it all taken care of. Thank you!"
@united need assistance. Line is out the door and travelling with 3 kids.
"@USAirways 
Are you an incompetent airline every day, or just days that end in 'y'?"
"@VirginAmerica @LadyGaga @CarrieUnderwood Sorry, Mary Martin had it first!"

@AmericanAir no worries even though I was talking about seat assignment :)
"@SouthwestAir can't checkin online for 2:00 flight tmrw fr. Cancun. ""Undefined error"" &amp; 800# not working.Family of 4 don't want Cgroup! Help"

"@united can I get on a stand by list from ASE to ORD? I'm the only poor person in Aspen, that's why I'm asking for standby on twitter."
@united and I was denied an upgrade because of catering issues??? #poorservice
"@AmericanAir husband &amp; I complain about same flight. He gets voucher, I get nothing. Because he flew biz!? Who do I email about this?"
"@SouthwestAir its cool that my bags take a bit longer, dont give me baggage blue balls-turn the carousel on, tell me it's coming, then not."
"@united Do I need to use a Chase United Club pass for my 8yr old son, or can he come in with me on my pass?"
@AmericanAir to my destination. After waiting 2 hours and missing our second flight with them. Our #luggage made the flight though...
@USAirways never received such horrible service or treated so poorly as Richard P. today. No excuse for attitude &amp; ripping up our tickets!
@JetBlue 290 to Boston
"@AmericanAir second, she sat on the Tarmac for 3 hrs only to be told it would be 30 mins"
@AmericanAir I am trying to change the time of a flight I already purchased and was told I have to pay a $400 change fee. Ridiculous.

@JetBlue what is the reason for the delay
"@USAirways 6 hours, no agent. Should I keep waiting?"
@SouthwestAir were you handing out tickets while I was sleep ?
"@united Yes, filled out the form last year. Don't have case number handy. Guess I'm not cut out for the historical society afterall"
"@united 2/2 Instead, had to wait on plane from Ottawa that never came. Now I'm back home and have to try again tomorrow. Suitcase still lost"
@AmericanAir Aww cool! It's nice to know they are still up above my head then. One of my faves.
@JetBlue today my family gets to experience #mosaic status w/ me! #LifeIsGood

@USAirways Ok Thanks
@SouthwestAir yes please!
@USAirways I was told there is no record of my refund.  Can someone please help me. This has been a long day
@USAirways I've flown US Airways at least five times. Every single time has been like this. Actions speak louder than words.
@united they did on a delta flight out of LAX which is why I should be compensated for my rental car there.
@united Based on suggestions from other passengers I have a rental car on standby for 11:30.  One way or another will be leaving then.
@USAirways  last 2 times I checked a bags they were severally damaged.   No one answers the baggage call line for status?  #chairmanlove
"@USAirways paid to upgrade to first class, went up to Admirals club at PHX airport to be turned away because our flight is to CUN and not MC"
@USAirways so I still need to stay on hold? http://t.co/04SDytT7zd

@SouthwestAir oh look you just delayed our flight an additional half hour now arriving at 6 officially five hours after planned. üò°üò°üò°üò°üò§üò§üò§

@AmericanAir AA 100 - good job overselling this flight. Delayed 90 minutes to deplane the overflow passengers' bags.
@JetBlue so yesterday a flight I wanted to Chicago was on sale within my points range and today it isn't. Any way you guys can still honor
@AmericanAir Thanks for sharing these photos! Round of applause for your crews! We appreciate all their hard work.
"@USAirways it was 1838, almost 5 hours Late Flight due  to mechanical."

@united Is flight 746 going to sit on the tarmac FOREVER?????????
"@JetBlue if you can get us on a flight to Vieques all will be good. Right now, not looking promising."

@SouthwestAir what does TSA Pre on my boarding pass mean? http://t.co/0HmmQCzkCf

@AmericanAir I let a crew member know every time this happens.  Which is most of the time.
"@AmericanAir I'd like to explore both options, and what the cost might be to change the date and destination."
"@united take a lesson from @VirginAmerica , they know how to treat customers!"
@united service so far has been horrid. We wanted to end the trip on a high note. Guess that's not an option.
@USAirways delays to the max
"@AmericanAir follows the Talent PM of #BDSM porn site http://t.co/UQGW6qsFFU. New ""Economy Dungeon"" class coming? http://t.co/pl9Sop5IHu"

@JetBlue you guys rock!
@JetBlue that's where we all get on the same page. Cancelled Flighted it 45 mins ago. @delta @SouthwestAir help flights from @tfgreenairport to MCO?

@united @danahajek : United's CEO has decided to outsource and or push out more and more of their skilled and loyal employees..lack of staff
@united Was just hung up on by customer service after waiting 30 min on hold...guess that vacation's not happening? Website wasn't working.
@JetBlue wouldn't mind paying for the snacks but no $ for tix :-) Great job guys!
@AmericanAir @DuaneNClark  ever think about being prepared and bringing in more people? Does anyone have any business sense at AA?
@united you would think you would clean your ramps. Our jet is stuck in the snow in Newark. This would never happen with @Delta
@USAirways Just spoke with a representative. Moved my flight earlier. Thank you so much for the follow up.
@SouthwestAir = easy and pleasant. @united = difficult and stressful. Learned my lesson.
@united how about plowing the snow at a gate before the plane arrives so we don't sit for 45 minutes after an 8 hr flight.... Fail
@united did I win :)
@USAirways @PhilaCarService looks like a long trip from cancun to philly? 9 hours Late Flight? Seriously?
@JetBlue thanks for the upgradeüòâ!! so far so good. #KeepItUp http://t.co/BKmfeY7QOL
@JetBlue hi friend! Question for you when you have a moment.
"@USAirways flt 4439 is on the ground, but you don't have a gate for us at dca. Why is this happening?"
"@VirginAmerica hi! I just bked a cool birthday trip with you, but i can't add my elevate no. cause i entered my middle name during Flight Booking Problems üò¢"
@united empathizes w/ my disappointment that 1stClass flight w/nonworking entertainmnt is worth $50. #UnFriendlySkies http://t.co/lOecO4gmvd
@united so 8 hotels for 32 people but feel like we are being held hostage because someone has our boarding passes so we can't leave! #FAIL
@united here we go again. 2 of 3 segments SFO--New York RT were delayed OVER 2 hrs each! Why do you suck so BAD!?!Maybe another line of bus?
"@united  Your survey is too long.  I fly a lot of segments and I'll fill it out after every trip, but not if it takes more than a minute."
@united I didn't have time to take my wet clothes/suit back to the airport and wasn't going to pay for another cab to do so.
@AmericanAir my understanding is they were able and did for many other flights but chose not to for this one.
"@USAirways yes thanks I have never seen anything like this and I come to Yuma all the time, big disappointment. There are 40+ still waiting"
@JetBlue Thanks for the complimentary upgrade to first.  You are the best!
@SouthwestAir 2nd leg of trip Cancelled Flightled. Been on hold 1.5 hrs. Will we lose our $ if we don't speak to someone before first flight leaves?

@SouthwestAir I want to file a formal complaint against a disgruntled employee @ LaGuardia who ruined mltple people's travel plans yesterday

@united still waiting for a response on whether or not you allow use of a rear facing car seat on an ERJ145.

@USAirways Thank you glad to be home. There were lots of delays with the plane and flight crew didn't show up. It was very frustrating.
@AmericanAir you have said the same thing to me over and over again but phrased differently. How about some actual help?
@united so funny that my boarding pass said PRIORITY a because clearly I am not a priority to this airline
@AmericanAir sucks!! Teco teco #reclameaqui #TripAdvisor http://t.co/auGJsCmoLu
"@USAirways you got me home 30 hours after you were supposed to... I was living in an airport, you offered no monetary assistance!"

@AmericanAir I'm going to speak with customer service at the airport tomorrow morning and see what my options are. I need a flight tomorrow
@JetBlue I've spoken 2/emailed JB team and explained situation. Didnt seem to matter to anyone other than me. I guess I just expected more.
@united make sure you make Cancelled Flighted flight baggage and upgrade fees seem like a labyrinth so that you might be able to swindle a few $ more
@united what time should I arrive at the airport for my 6:15 am domestic flight out of San Diego?
@united I don't see how I need to spend an extra $100 bc of ur equipment failure.

"@united don't need your apologies, need my bag. Took 56 minutes from landing to get it. Unacceptable."

@AmericanAir my mom‚Äôs flight tomorrow Cancelled Flighted w/ no notice. Phone system said callback in 2 hours and it‚Äôs been 4. I need to go to bed!
@AmericanAir The issue is the lack of consideration of an announcement made so Late Flight when the gate agent had been there for over an hour.
@USAirways how do I get thru on hold 3 hours 5 minutes . Is this normal ? My call is lost
@USAirways I just want to find my bag so I won't have to go through the hassle of trying to claim what was in my suitcase #usairwaysfail
@SouthwestAir All's well. I got comped with multiple other bags which just made my day! http://t.co/1AAVvoREpH
@united absolutely disgusting the way you treat your customers. Isn't there anyone actively monitoring your Cust serve? This is  unreal!!
"@JetBlue is JFK still closed? Tryna get out of Ft Lauderdale on flight 502, just want to get home to nyc!"

"@JetBlue Are you having any issues with online check-in? My colleague and I are getting ""Webpage not available"" after submitting online form"

@united I am so happy I found my phone because this is easily the worst system I have ever heard of
"@SouthwestAir @BrittanyOBX11, keeping families apart w/ your quirky, archaic policies. Any other airline accommodates in this situation."
@JetBlue what is a personal email that I can contact? I have a complaint that you should know about
@JetBlue never had an airline refuse to help sit parents with tiny kids. But this guy is willing to do it. #JetBlue http://t.co/MzZfGqfHu2
@AmericanAir dont send me a tweet to cover your social media complaints. How about sending me a message with a way to resolve?!?! #CustServ
@USAirways You won't give us a hotel or food. Can you at least suggestion options for making it to the metro city I have a ticket to?

@United What's your phone number? Customer service question.
@united our 1 layover itinerary was swapped for a 3 layover itinerary - really?!?
@USAirways  glad to be home and that your great people got me home safely. Sad for others who didn't get back bc of scheduling problems.
"@united all goods, I'll call tomorrow, thanks."
@USAirways Dude named Shaquille at the desk in Charlotte was incredibly professional and helpful vs. some crazy angry people tonight

@USAirways I know some folks have to use your airlines but doesn't customer service ever matter? I really hate to complain but it's brutal!
@USAirways over 15min hold on your reservation line. embarrassing. AA Platinum member.
@USAirways you keep suggesting people call 800-428-4322 but we just end up on hold for hours. You seriously don't have a better method?!
@SouthwestAir please send me a number to call to talk to a person and not be put on hold
@united (2/2) pay in person at Portland airport. I will be flying from Perth. This has been done by US Air.

@SouthwestAir   Thanks
@JetBlue - looking forward to it when we finally take off.
@JetBlue Found someone to ask. No answers. Landed almost 40 minutes ago.
@UsAirways  your person taking tickets is rude and now we are delayed 4-50 minutes because you overfilled fuel on the plane #500.
@united why are your SFO-&gt;BOS nonstop flights not competitively priced with those of JetBlue and Virgin? $179 vs $324. Identical times.

@SouthwestAir hey... Why don't you add the intl number to your error when checking in. Going on 6 hrs looking for a way to checkin. #cancun
@AmericanAir I'm not sure what happened to my USAirways status when the merger took place.
@AmericanAir my husband and 5 year old son stuck overnight in DC thanks to 7 crew members arguing over who was boarding the flight
@JetBlue Seems very likely.
@USAirways That's not the question. Question is: how do I get past the computer fastest if we both know that the computer can't help me?
@SouthwestAir thank you kindly.
@SouthwestAir Thanks for taking care of me Today!  Michele rocked the customer service! Gate 25 HOU
@AmericanAir I can't get through to a customer rep to help me out. This is the only option I have got.
@USAirways express my disappointment in your reservation department and the treatment of a Sailor dealing with a death in the family
@SouthwestAir flight to PHL from FLL Cancelled Flighted 2/21 no flight available until 2/24 done with SW. They are a pain to deal with
@VirginAmerica you know it. Need it on my spotify stat #guiltypleasures
"@SouthwestAir Secondly, we did not begin boarding on time despite our aircraft being present and deplaned. Thus we left over 30 min Late Flight"
@USAirways more like USDELAY-ways. Another long 'paperwork' reLate Flightd delay - Friday in Charlotte. Today in Philly. #letsgoalready
"@USAirways of course! ""Yeah, travel has gotten harder. Ask other passengers if they will switch"" it's not the fact, it's the attitude!"
"@united In 2015, United is ""unable"" to look up a flight reservation by passenger name at the YYZ check-in counter - WOW smh #customerservice"
"@SouthwestAir Lastly, for a company that's trying to put the love in flying it would be nice to have someone personally address my concerns."
@virginamerica Trying to make the change in advance (not just 24 hours prior)‚Ä¶tried it online earlier and it wanted $300 in change fees.
@united So what's allowed or what's not allowed to be carried in my checked baggage?
@AmericanAir How are you going to compensate all of whose days/plans have been ruined because of the AA3490 delay/pending Cancelled Flightlation?
"Nice try @AmericanAir I heard your crew whisper ""she's still at the hotel, she probably doesn't think she has to work until tomorrow"""
@united thanks. Just got on a couple of minutes ago. Great service on flight 479 btw. Please pass it to the team on that flight.
@SouthwestAir did you know that suicide is the second leading cause of death among teens 10-24
@AmericanAir your customer service is a disgrace.
@JetBlue Do your TrueBlue pages not work on Chrome or Safari? I keep getting blank pages when I lick on the TrueBlue tab on your site.
@united -huge kudos to the FO of Sunday's flt #1623 sjo-iad. Handed my daughter her first pair of wings! Keeping traditions alive.

@united no because you will charge me or delay me further. United 1612 still waiting.
"@united how come it's cheaper to fly to BKK than NRT even though to get to BKK you take an extra flight, from NRT!"
@united no I did not make connection.  Your stellar employee Vicky Thomas refused to board me even though 23 empty seats on plane

"@united: I don't care that a @thehipmunk link showed me a ""wrong"" price on your site‚Äîit's your site &amp; responsibility to ensure correctness."
@AmericanAir These birds could fly to South America for example #Argentina
@USAirways has the WORST customer service and their flights are always delayed
"@VirginAmerica And now the flight Flight Booking Problems site is totally down. Folks, what is the problem?"

@JetBlue with 3 kids and 11 days 340 + doesn't work and it's months in advance
@SouthwestAir I figured the streaming wouldn't work per the TOS but just the @NASCAR site is taking longer than 5 minutes to load
"@SouthwestAir used to love you, but you keep rescheduling my flights.  #southworst"
@united :take note of this great example of @JetBlue actually making good for an extremely inconvenient situation. http://t.co/t3Gnk2N7LD
@AmericanAir please improve business extra flight reservation process. can't book online?  what century are we in? 25 min+ on hold
"Wanted to get my bag benefit, but instead get $25 pricing on all three tickets. When adding a card, MP Visa is only option. @united"
@united will the kudos to capt. Herman be relayed to his chief pilot or should I be emailing someone?

@SouthwestAir Thanks for getting us to paradise safely! http://t.co/KDzQcZlpyR

@usairways 2 people working the counter at #dca? Massive lines. Poorly played. #winterstorm
@USAirways Why can't I check in online for a flight tomorrow am?
"@AmericanAir Will it be this year, do you think?"
"@USAirways Would love to combine AA and USAir accts. Unfortunately, one has my middle name &amp; one has middle initial. Won't allow change"

@USAirways Already tried. How about Conf # via DM
"@SouthwestAir @ClinicPolly 
Thank you-- I may have already responded but was 8UXZJ2"
@united it's disgusting and unconscionable the treatment I've received tonight.

"@JetBlue 2 hour delay while sitting on the plane and you still wanna charge me for beer? Nah, I'm good."
@SouthwestAir I paid for inflight wifi only for it not to work. Download speed was 0.21mbps &amp; I ended up watching the free TV instead.
@USAirways sadly that didn't help me at my meeting at work today seeing as my presentation was in there! Major strike against me!!!
@SouthwestAir is making dreams come true with their #DestinationDragons scavenger hunt! You can win a chance to see Imagine Dragons! Go!
"@AmericanAir LGA already by the time we pulled from the flight. QQBMUG. feel free to look up how many flights we've been ""reticketed"" on."
@VirginAmerica Use another browser! 2015 &amp; a brand with a reputation built on tech response doesn't have a cross-browser compatible website?
"@JetBlue I hear you and safety is #1! I think we can get to JFK though now so let's help the pilots, passengers &amp; crew get there safely!"

@SouthwestAir inflight entertainment.  Tonight a Willie Nelson impersonator sang for the passengers #peanutsandtoons http://t.co/kCDdOD7uFF
@united I have a question
@JetBlue  Not blaming Jet Blue.  This wasn't weather. Can't have planes in the air and runways a mess. That's a disaster waiting to happen.
@united Everyone around us is sitting with their friends and family members. They booked their tickets in October and December. We bought
@united needs to pay for my car. I could have been on my flight if 4 help desks did not say it already left. Shame.
"@JetBlue we tried. They're not at all helpful. Terrible customer service, at this airport, at least."
@AmericanAir I'm home &amp; only 9hr Late Flight.  No thanks to your service centre - their plan involved 4 flight legs all across NA and 2 full days..
@USAirways @AmericanAir any help regarding flights out of KPHL would be much appreciated
@SouthwestAir from LGA to San Diego
"@USAirways BF has been stuck in CLT all day. Is the lounge offering free ""This weather sucks &amp; we all want to cry"" tequila shots?"
@USAirways I spent more on the room &amp; transportation then I did the whole flight
"@JetBlue the lack of TV made it rough, that's literally why I picked y'all over the competitors."
"@AmericanAir but my friend was told she was able to use her credit with the airline towards one of my flights, then was told she couldn't."
@JetBlue she hung up before I can get name. She took no accountability for keeping me on hold +20min. Next rep was not able to track name
@united Give Cyndi &amp; Troy each a gold star.
@united all good man it isn't your fault that plane is having maintenance issues
"@SouthwestAir @JasonWhitely flt 947 Emer stop in Albuquer for a heart condition, crew was awesome, pilot was Maverick on the divert."
@AmericanAir Amazing to watch @chasefoster (who travels with celebs all over the world) show the youth of America who *not* to fly with.
@united @el_ingeniero don't check your baggage if you don't have to.  They will lose it!
@USAirways is the 7th circle of hell right after the dmv. #noshadetothedmv
@USAirways @nanceebing 4 hour hold times at the moment...and counting. #disgrace
"@JetBlue after applying my new tag, she left my bag on the ground rather than loading on the conveyer belt..I had to walk back 50 yards"
"@usairways trick for getting into your hold queue?  I've been calling since Thursday and keep getting the ""call back Late Flightr"" message"
@united we needed to be at steamboat for a meeting by 3pm so we took a shuttle. The United customer service people said the bag would be on
@united Never had a flight delayed an hour due to an unbalanced load. And more delays at @flyLAXairport. Great job idiots.
"@SouthwestAir i live in the southwest, Imagine Dragons is my favorite band, and i met my 2bestfriends thanks to them. it would be amazing +"

@united Will never fly with you again! Terrible service!! Ruined our entire vacation!! #lostsuitcase #noreimbursement

"@USAirways http://t.co/AXRYeIWzh0, vuelo24.es, vuelos24.es sell too cheap MAD-NYC with USAirways. Are they trusted webs or is it a scam?"

@USAirways 4 hours on hold to change a Cancelled Flightled flight. Completely unacceptable!!!
"@USAirways announced that people going to FL via Charlotte would have to go to a different plane &amp; gate, but it was a 'direct flight' #logic"

@AmericanAir No apology necessary. It was wind and I was on Delta. XOXO
@united this is nuts they said a flight was on the ground now it's still in Albany and they won't have a plane.  Someone is compensating me

@AmericanAir Huge thanks for fixing our flights! appreciate the customer service. now if only i could get seats assigned: me next to my wife
@United I'm hoping we don't miss our LAX - ITO connection. Not looking forward to being stuck at LAX overnight with our team....AGAIN!
@SouthwestAir needs to train their employees to be at lease somewhat empathetic when THEY lose our luggage.  Monika at MWA needs a PR lesson

@AmericanAir is there any way you could put me up in a hotel for the night?? If not I'm having to sleep at the airport again tonight.
@united I really have a hard time believing that 4 planes in this terminal are all delayed for mechanical issues. #whatgives #dullessucks
@JetBlue Thanks. I'm finding lower fares already on other carriers with direct flights. July 8 - 13.
@SouthwestAir Received email w/reso's to my email that isn't associated to SWA account I own with CC info for my sister. #FRAUD please DM me
@AmericanAir Why not sell MCE during post door-close shuffle in same way u sell drinks/snacks? People on my flight self-upgraded w/o paying.
@SouthwestAir -17mph winds and would do anything to be in Florida right now.. help a sister out!!
"@USAirways It's 838. We boarded and we are waiting now to take off, hopefully."
@united Thanks!
"@united UA6255 delayed out of #winnipeg because the plane was ""frozen""! #fail Will I make my connection on UA1059? #tightconnection #Denver"
@united 20 min more delays to flt 2086 at sfo 2 load 2 more pax makes no sense. Will strand many of us overnight at ORD due to missed cnxns
"@USAirways @AmericanAir as a Gold Dividends member, why can't I get anyone on phone to handle my Cancelled Flighted American flight tonight üò°"
@united I am a comedian and I promise I will make fun of you on stage tonight.
@AmericanAir thanks
"@JetBlue honestly I‚Äôm glad you didn‚Äôt Cancelled Flight the flight, just that I‚Äôll be driving home at 3-4 am now. :/"
@SouthwestAir we were rebooked on the 5:05 out of MDW.  Some drink coupons could help!
@united how is Mexico not international from the us?
@SouthwestAir Maybe if you comped those that quietly accepted delays or Cancelled Flightations instead of the irate you'd have less issues #justsaying
"@JetBlue you don't need to cut services, charge more and give a better flying experience. That's why I use jet blue in the first place"
@VirginAmerica I called a 3-4 weeks ago about adding 3 flights from 2014 to my Elevate...they still haven't shown up...help!
@USAirways @AmericanAir  worst customer service ever how can you let people be assaulted on your flights and do nothing about it
"@USAirways ""good news. We've located the crew and made contact with them"". flight was supposed to leave 4 minutes ago. #usairwaysfail"
"@AmericanAir if by near the gate you mean sitting on the plane for almost 2 hours, then yeah."
"@united : flight delayed by 24 hours, lost my wallet, have no money to eat or sleep yet your representatives will not help.#unitedsucks"
@united 4016 529557.   You going to transfer my car to me too?  Because it's at the airport you couldn't get me too...
@united I did they did not.  I did submit a complaint on line and never heard back from that - I don't have that ID- you should find it
@united website says my flight is on time. It leaves in 15 min and nobody has boarded yet. #pathetic #needtobehonest
@united please update what is going to happen to passengers now that flt ua14 has been Cancelled Flightled
@AmericanAir I've been on hold ANOTHER hour and still nothing. My Cancelled Flighted flight was supposed to be six hours from now. #Stranded
@USAirways thanks!
@united it was eventually explained that weather conditions too extreme to get luggage off planes. Will be sent on. But I won't be for days!
@AmericanAir Thanks! Great stuff! I can only imagine how jammed everything is.
@VirginAmerica Good point!
@USAirways quit being cheap and hire some call center employees. It shouldn't take half a day to call you
@AmericanAir sitting in a 2 hour long at least phone queue. Hoping I get things rebooked in time or at least some plastic wings. #tears
"@AmericanAir my flight was Cancelled Flightled, leaving tomorrow morning. Auto rebooked for a Tuesday night flight but need to arrive Monday."
"@SouthwestAir @CallMeStanley7 And bring back the ""Agent will call you back..."" feature. Why was that ever discontinued???"
"@JetBlue = WORST. Booked in Oct. w/ email confirm &amp; NEVER INFORMED Cancelled Flightlation. Instructed ""to mail written letter"" http://t.co/c7Kzbvf8h8"
@usairways  this is ridiculous at CLT  and we missed our connecting flight because of a chuckhole  on runway??  #shameful (1/1)
http://t.co/EIw2sYb8Fu roberts&amp;s=1 @AmericanAir
@united I will. I have to get to Bangkok. I have just 17 days to spend with my husband in his mid deployment leave. Like to get there asap
@JetBlue What happened w/#19 from BOS-SAN? My mother is onboard &amp; the crew was evasive as to why they had to return to BOS the first time.
@JetBlue  Alright I hope. My JetBlue app is showing a change in my seats and online shows an a320.  Don't want any surprises
"@united Honestly, I stopped trying to report things via website. Now I just laugh. Flights work. Miles accrue. I'm sure it's just cosmetic."
@USAirways you would rather a while plane get exposed to a nasty contagious virus then work wth me to get my flight changed to a Late Flightr date
@USAirways I made it- thx.
@AmericanAir flights have been on time Late Flightly though!
@JetBlue I have the emails that they are on their way
"@united yup, it just happens way too often...5 times in the last 12 months"
"@JetBlue marks 15th year with new ""Bluemanity"" plane design - Sun Sentinel http://t.co/SjVEelween"
"@AmericanAir I am running out of battery you have my chargers,clothes,coat,contact lenses, need to be in mtg tom need help #pathetic service"
@USAirways lol me too
"@AmericanAir Thank you for the info! Changes need to be made over the phone, correct? Is there any way an AA agent can call me directly?"
@VirginAmerica flight 404 delayed 2 hours in LA due to mechanical problems. Handle like pros but you could have tossed us a free drink.
"@AmericanAir That's good, I'd expect that but I can't get through on the phone to make any changes. Can I change it online?"
@united you guys are gay
@AmericanAir change fee = same price of new ticket... Not logical
@AmericanAir. For two days now I have been trying to reach #AmericanAirlines customer service to change my flight.
"@JetBlue Love you, bae. #JetBae"
@AmericanAir watch out if you are a parent...they break stroller &amp; tell you look at the fine print
"@USAirways sorry, we are in Philly. Should've told you that."
@united stuck here in IAH waiting on flight 253 to Honolulu for 7 hours due to maintenance issues. Could we have gotten a new plane!?!? Fail
@Southwestair thanks for leaving me hanging here. #destinationdragons flights all fucked up now. No help?!
"@VirginAmerica Funny story, your website is broken, you have missing javascript and stylesheets on the checkin process. I dislike this!"
"@SouthwestAir my sinuses had to contend with two painful landings rather than one, and we missed a preregistration window. Beyond frustrated"
@USAirways i got through and am able to switch my flight with no charge. Thank you
@AmericanAir @robinreda being stuck two days in the airport is not something pretty normal. I am positive you can find a plane to Europe
@AmericanAir it is absolutely unacceptable.  I have been calling all day and am hung up on every time. I just need a 5 minute bit of help!
@USAirways this is more than having patience. This is not acceptable. http://t.co/N7pSuEJDC8
@AmericanAir Thank you for the response. Much appreciated!
@USAirways how is your gate agent gonna tell me my flight is on time when its 5 minutes past departure time and the previous flights plane..
@AmericanAir I've tried...its @USAirways anyway
@AmericanAir thinks it's a good cs to get everyone through the gate for flight 4275 then we wait bc plane not ready http://t.co/rxmjWoo7Qi
@AmericanAir Oh they seem  to have reappeared now lol
@JetBlue Great thanks
"@USAirways My booked seat ended up being the last row which was labeled ""do no occupy"" had to play musical chairs for 30 mins. Unacceptable"
@USAirways fuck you.
@USAirways one question. Can I book one way tickets with award travel/points
@SouthwestAir Feeling very frustrated that I bought WIFI onboard and can't load an email.
@SouthwestAir hilarious flight attendants on Vegas to Detroit tonight http://t.co/nw7vx7DGMF
"@JetBlue What's up with delays to and from Boston today? My sister is trying to go home, and bro-in-law trying to come to RDU. Craziness!"
@united Flight 6212...massive fail! They delaying to transport a crew member causing many to miss connections! Unreal!
@USAirways F623 DEN:PHX. Serious display of poor customer service exhibited by flight crew today.   #newamericanairline #cheapslogannotmotto
@USAirways now on hold for 75 minutes.
@AmericanAir Flight 1512 (N924AN) departs @FlyTPA enroute to @dfwairport http://t.co/j0mhMkDiVl
"@VirginAmerica congrats, you just got all my business from EWR to SFO/LAX. Fuck you @united fl1289 SFO/EWR was the clincher..."
@USAirways thank you for refunding my bag fee.  I look forward to its return today I hope.
"@AmericanAir There was no one from #AA at the #woase2015 event @HelsinkiAirport
Lots of info available of #winterops"
@USAirways so apparently all of your computers crashed at BWI?  Any update on when flights will be moving?
@SouthwestAir would love to win tickets and take my son to Imagine Dragons in Provo Saturday night.  Crossed fingers. #DestinationDragons
"@AmericanAir that's ok, thanks for letting me know. Appreciate all the responses."
@USAirways  Interesting you forward compliments but never complaints!  World's worst airline #GoingForGreatnessFAIL
@USAirways thanks but the bags are only 10% of what went wrong. 22 hours from DCA to SAN when there were no weather issues is not acceptable
@SouthwestAir for your loyal A-list customers it should be easier to get help and bring resolution to issues with your rewards program.
"@USAirways ""We can't help you. We don't put people up in hotels when you miss a flight it's against policy."""
"@united Nope. Walked up &amp; down the ORF terminal, &amp; not a United agent to be found. Showed up @ last minute to board us. Many panicked people"
@AmericanAir thank you!
@USAirways yay for glitchy tracking system!  My bags made it to my destination and not Laguardia like the app said!
@USAirways why didn't you reroute BOS to JAX via DCA through CLT instead forcing an overnight @DCA #passengersLose
@USAirways takes my money at once but then requires 7 to 10 days to process a refund? Why does your auto attendant hang up? #usairwaysfail
@JetBlue what crew? No one here is helping.
@VirginAmerica will you be making BOS&gt;LAS non stop permanently anytime soon?
@AmericanAir narrowly made standby...lots of snags this trip!
@united and now your rep just hung up on me after over 35 mins on hold because I asked for a supervisor. I'm furious right now.
@united and was told that its been the case for weeks but is still not resolved.
@united - ok noted. All details will be DM'ed to you shortly.
@united on the plane. I was thoughtful enough to ask for it and got it; there are prob others that also deserved it
"@SouthwestAir went to front restroom on plane, on sink sign that said no water, use hand sanitizer. First time I've ever seen that. GROSS!"
@USAirways Hi-i have a travel question. Could you please follow me so i can dm you?
@JetBlue @Cinnabon the two of you should team up to serve cinnabons on the flights!!!! #BonsInTheSky
@JetBlue Thanks!
@AmericanAir really? Not even worthy of a response. This is beginning of a social media alert to the world that AA and @USAirways are useles
@united What is the point of a UPC code on checked baggage if you can't tell me where my luggage is? Vacation- day 3: trying on swimsuits...
@united ok. Can I DM you the info?
"@SouthwestAir been on the phone for about an hour waiting..can you please answer, Thank You!  #notcool"
@AmericanAir thanks to AA / DART for getting me home in time for work this morning DEN-DFW... didn't have to waste a vaca day @dartmedia
@JetBlue just please get my luggage from #2070 onto carousel 5 / Logan Airport and I'll be able to go home!
@JetBlue Airways Hits New 52-Week High at $17.58 (JBLU) - sleekmoney http://t.co/zdKXn4kTOu
@USAirways sucks.  Flt 2692 Late Flight by 20 mins missed my connection.  Thanks for the 10 bucks and a middle seat on the next flt.
@USAirways #Unbelievable that for 2 consecutive days I can't get through to a person.  On hold over 2 hours and still going
"@AmericanAir Thank you for the worst experience ever on an airline, from me to you, I hope your embarrassed as an airline. Pathetic"
@AmericanAir POOR EXPERIENCE 2day at ord chkin. 8 emp. w/3 cust. 10 waiting. Asked to speak w/supervisor. Told 20 min. In a mtg!! What?!?!
‚Äú@united: @BattierCCIpuppy Your puppy is so cute. We look forward to having both of you on board. Thanks for the high five. ^EY‚Äù üëèüëè
@united I didn't get a message from you. I'll resend numbers.
@SouthwestAir same here. Would appreciate a follow so I can DM my info to figure out what I am supposed to do.
"@AmericanAir mission accomplished today, Thank you!"
@AmericanAir please message me for assistance - can't get through to anyone.
@AmericanAir @cnnbrk they didn't address the assult or drinks spilled on her  the drunk passenger had to have a wheelchair to get off plane
@SouthwestAir traditionally used sledge hammer - low $ taking share from driving | now scalpel approach through data science  #ANAmarketers
"@JetBlue w/ edits: Dear @msbgu , your MBAs need better benefits. They should work for us. How can we meet them?"
@SouthwestAir thanks for taking such good care of my luggage... http://t.co/PIvxean3jY
@AmericanAir Great seats on this aircraft!
@united iCloud it is not there yet -- PLEASE HELP 917 703 1472
@JetBlue? | RT @WMCActionNews5: New airline expected to make its way to MEM http://t.co/vO3eQsEPqH
"@united traveling from FRA thru IAD to MCO tomorrow, concerned abt IAD weather. Can't change until advisory issued? Any advice?"
"@AmericanAir not only did you rebook me on the wrong day, your phone system says it can't handle the volume and hangs up on me!!!"
@AmericanAir 4828 but I just missed it because no one is at the gate to marshall us in so now I have to rent a car &amp; drive 5 hrs. So thanks.
@VirginAmerica we have a hot female pilot! Sweet! DCA to SFO! :-)
@united we just left @flySFO (delayed). http://t.co/XzBAjMiekx
@united appreciate the sentiment and you were able to get me off the ground;still missed connection
@united yea get me to phoenix already. Delays all day with you people. It's bullshit.
Looking forward to using Passbook when I fly  @SouthwestAir in a few weeks!
"@USAirways 835, fix this ASAP"
‚Äú@JetBlue: @FinleyBklynCFS So glad to hear. Thanks for sharing the video.‚Äù Me and JetBlue are #BFF üôè
"@VirginAmerica Really missed a prime opportunity for Men Without Hats parody, there. https://t.co/mWpG7grEZP"
"@united Can someone assist me with my DM's? Waiting 1 hour on phone, 2 hours on Twitter."
They didnt just tweet this... Nah. RT ‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/1yLn1Gx4QX‚Äù
@AmericanAir most horrendous service ever !! On off two planes. Been in Phil for 10 hrs. Now captain can't get flight info to print? #wtf
@USAirways Marsha M. at Myrtle Beach is the greatest! She deserves all the respect and praise there is! #ThankYouForEverything
@united to DM you I have to follow you and I'm not doing that. Plus they're no more options. That's why I had to fly with you. #epicfail
"@AmericanAir After being patient about my ""delayed"" bags for 5 weeks, I was told that it could take another 3 to 5 weeks. Unacceptable!"
"@united thanks, I'm booked. Just spent an extra 7 hrs in the TEN w/ no explanation. Now flying middle seat to CHAR instead of Memphis."
@SouthwestAir crazy hold times today. Over an hour now. Help?
